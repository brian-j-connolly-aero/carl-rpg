the Dungeon Crawler World universe centers on an intergalactic government, known as the Syndicate, which runs a reality TV show called "Dungeon Crawler World." In this show, planets are routinely transformed into dangerous, multi-leveled dungeons filled with traps, monsters, and challenges. The surviving inhabitants of these planets, known as "crawlers," must then navigate the dungeon to reclaim resources taken by the Syndicate during the planet's transformation.

The dungeon is overseen by a powerful (and juvenile) System AI which controls the environment, doles out rewards, and interfaces with the crawlers through a HUD (heads-up display) and menu system. Crawlers earn experience points, level up, acquire skills, and choose a race and class as they progress. They are aided by loot boxes, healing items, and their own wits and abilities.

The Syndicate is composed of various alien races, corporations, and political entities who sponsor the show for entertainment and profit. 

Crawlers who survive and become fan favorites can gain sponsors, rewards, and special privileges. However, the dungeon is designed to be brutally difficult, with permadeath a constant threat.

Introduction to Dungeon Crawler World
Dungeon Crawler World is a complex, immersive game set on Earth after a cataclysmic event known as The Transformation. This guide introduces the foundational mechanics players encounter as they navigate through the game's challenging environment, known as the World Dungeon. Here, players (referred to as crawlers) must choose their paths carefully, selecting races and classes, engaging in Faction Wars, battling bosses for rewards, and forming or joining guilds for communal success.

The Transformation and the World Dungeon
Overview of The Transformation
The Transformation is a pivotal event that reshaped Earth, leading to the creation of the World Dungeon, an 18-floor labyrinth designed to test the skills, wit, and strength of every crawler daring enough to enter. The Transformation not only altered the physical world but also introduced a myriad of mystical and dangerous elements, forcing humans and animals alike to adapt or perish.

Structure and Floors of the World Dungeon
The World Dungeon is structured into 18 distinct floors, each presenting unique challenges, monsters, and bosses. As crawlers progress, the difficulty increases, but so do the potential rewards. Each floor has a specific theme and ecosystem, designed to push crawlers to their limits and encourage strategic gameplay.

Crawlers: Entering the Dungeon
Race and Class Selection
Upon entering the Dungeon, players must select a race and class for their crawler. This choice is crucial as it determines the skills, abilities, and potential path the crawler can take. The Dungeon's AI offers recommendations based on the player's initial performance and preferences, but the ultimate choice lies with the player. Classes range from basic options like Bards and Fighters to more specialized ones such as Necromancers and Warlocks, each with unique abilities and progression paths.

Specialization and Advancement
As crawlers progress through the floors, opportunities to specialize or further define their class become available, notably on the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth floors. Specialization can significantly affect a crawler's strategy and gameplay style, offering new skills, spells, and abilities tailored to the crawler's chosen path. Additionally, crawlers are introduced to guilds on the sixth floor, allowing them to join forces with others for shared benefits and upgrades.

HUD and Crawler Menu Interface
HUD Features and Upgrades
Upon entering the Dungeon, crawlers are equipped with a Heads-Up Display (HUD), a critical tool that provides real-time information about their health, mana, and surroundings. This interface is customizable and can show notifications, achievements, and a minimap among other features. As players progress, they can upgrade their HUD to display more detailed information, such as more sophisticated health and mana bars, a more comprehensive minimap, and a hotlist for quick access to potions, spells, and items.

Crawler Menu Tabs and Functions
The Crawler Menu is an extension of the HUD, offering in-depth access to a crawler's inventory, stats, skills, messages, and more. Key tabs include:

Inventory: Manages items and equipment.
Player Stats: Displays current stats and allows for the distribution of stat points upon leveling up.
Skills Menu: Lists available skills and their levels.
Magic Menu: Manages spells and mana usage.
Messaging Menu: For communication with other crawlers and NPCs.
Party Menu: Facilitates party management and group chat among party members.
Pet Menu: If a crawler has pets, this menu manages their stats and abilities.
Faction Wars and Adjutants
Faction Wars are competitive events where teams of crawlers align with different factions to compete for dominance. Adjutants, neutral third-party consultants, and referees play a crucial role in these wars, ensuring fair play and enforcing rules. They also provide commentary and recaps of the day's events, enhancing the spectator experience. Adjutants have access to an expanded ruleset and can call out rule violations, but their actions are closely monitored by the Dungeon's AI to ensure impartiality.

Dungeon Bosses and Rewards
Each floor of the World Dungeon is guarded by bosses that crawlers must defeat to advance. Boss fights are significant milestones, offering substantial rewards upon victory. Rewards include loot boxes, gear, and achievements, with the rarity and value of these rewards increasing with the level of the boss defeated. Special achievements are awarded for defeating bosses, contributing to a crawler's reputation and standings on the Dungeon Leaderboard.

Guilds and Parties
Guilds are formed as crawlers reach the sixth floor, providing a framework for cooperation and shared resources. Crawlers can join existing guilds or create their own, with a guild charter purchased from a Dungeon NPC. Guild membership allows access to a common area, shared upgrades, and the potential for experience sharing. Guild leaders manage memberships and can assign roles within the guild, such as administration rights. Forming or joining a guild can significantly impact a crawler's survival and success in the Dungeon, offering a communal approach to overcoming challenges.


Game Guides and Tutorial Guild Halls
Role of Game Guides
Game Guides are essential NPCs who guide crawlers through the initial stages of the Dungeon, especially during the Tutorial phase. They are typically experienced crawlers who have chosen to serve in a non-combatant role, providing newcomers with crucial knowledge about the game's mechanics, HUD, and menu systems. Guides are responsible for teaching crawlers how to navigate their interfaces, understand their stats, and start their journey on the right foot. After completing the tutorial, the Game Guide becomes a crawler's registered mentor, offering advice and assistance until the crawler reaches the Fourth Floor.

Tutorial Process and Guild Halls
The Tutorial is a mandatory process for all new crawlers, conducted within Tutorial Guild Halls located on the first three floors of the Dungeon. These halls serve as safe zones where crawlers can learn the game's mechanics without the threat of enemy attacks. The tutorial covers everything from basic movement and combat to more complex systems like inventory management and skill development. Completing the tutorial unlocks the full HUD and Crawler Menu, equipping players with the tools they need to succeed in the Dungeon.

Loot Boxes and Rewards
Loot Boxes are a vital component of Dungeon Crawler World, distributed as rewards for achieving specific milestones or victories. They are categorized into different tiers, ranging from Bronze to Celestial, with the rarity and value of the contents scaling accordingly. Higher-tier boxes contain more powerful and unique items, making them highly sought after. Crawlers can acquire loot boxes through various means, including defeating bosses, completing challenges, or as gifts from fans and sponsors. Opening a Loot Box requires being in a safe room and presents crawlers with a selection of gear, potions, and potentially game-changing equipment.

Pets and Dungeon Familiars
Acquiring and Bonding with Pets
In Dungeon Crawler World, pets serve as loyal companions that can assist crawlers in various ways, from combat support to utility functions. Pets must be bonded with to unlock their full potential, a process that allows them to gain experience, level up, and develop new abilities. Some classes and races have specific affinities for pets, granting them unique benefits or the ability to bond with more powerful creatures.

Dungeon Familiars vs. Crawler Pets
Dungeon Familiars are unique entities that entered the Dungeon from the surface and were assigned crawler IDs. Unlike regular pets, they do not require bonding and often possess innate abilities or characteristics beneficial to their companion crawler. However, the distinction between pets and familiars blurs as both can play critical roles in a crawler's strategy and survival within the Dungeon.

Elite Entities in the Dungeon
Characteristics of Elites
Elites are powerful, one-of-a-kind entities within the Dungeon, offering both formidable challenges and opportunities for crawlers. They can be NPCs or mobs with unique abilities and personalities, often playing key roles in the Dungeon's ecosystem. Encounters with Elites can lead to either conflict or cooperation, influencing the crawler's journey in significant ways. The presence of an Elite can dramatically alter the dynamics of exploration, combat, and strategy, making them pivotal figures in the Dungeon's lore and mechanics.

Interactions with Elites
Navigating interactions with Elites requires careful consideration, as these entities can offer valuable alliances, quests, or rewards. However, they may also pose deadly threats. The relationship between crawlers and Elites adds depth to the game's narrative and strategic complexity, encouraging players to weigh their decisions carefully.

Dungeon Leaderboard and Achievements
How the Leaderboard Works
The Dungeon Leaderboard is a competitive feature that ranks crawlers based on their achievements, level, and notable accomplishments within the game. It serves as a benchmark for progress and prestige, motivating crawlers to improve their standings through skillful play, strategic decision-making, and successful completion of high-level challenges. Being featured on the Leaderboard increases a crawler's fame, attracting attention from sponsors and fans alike.

Achievements and Their Impact
Achievements in Dungeon Crawler World recognize a wide range of accomplishments, from defeating bosses and completing quests to mastering specific skills or contributing to the community. Earning achievements can unlock rewards, such as loot boxes or access to exclusive areas and items, and also plays a crucial role in a crawler's reputation and progression. Achievements not only mark milestones but also influence a crawler's journey by opening new paths and possibilities.
