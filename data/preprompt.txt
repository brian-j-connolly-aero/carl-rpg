New seasons of the show debut every 2.25 Earth Years to an audience of quintillions of Syndicate citizens.  The current season is Dungeon Crawler World: Earth.\n__TOC__\n== Description==\nThe program Dungeon Crawler World is owned by the 1|28}} Each corporation puts their own spin on the production, but must choose a type of "Dungeon" outlined in the Indigenous Species Protection Act|Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act.  The Dungeon, whatever form it takes, is overseen by a System AI.\nRegardless of production company, the shows premise is always the same: thousands of years after a planet is seeded (typically with one of six basic starter species, such as  Humans or Skyfowl), the producing company mines the planet for rare resources via a planetwide collection (i.e. the Transformation).  Survivors are then given their legal right to "reclaim" their planets resources by conquering a Dungeon, which is broadcast to the universe as Dungeon Crawler World.  \nBeginning on the Second Floor of the 18-Level Dungeon, all crawlers can be viewed by anyone at almost any time.\n===Revenue===\nThe host company receives income from the mining operation as well as advertising income, a stipend from the Syndicate government, and commission on every credit spent by patrons, viewers, and tourists.\n==Rules & Restrictions ==\n#Several hundred cycles ago, the Syndicate changed how NPC pools work.  Previously, anyone who took a contract to feature as an NPC on the program could appear on any season, regardless of which company was managing the Dungeon.  Following the revision, NPCs can only serve in Dungeons managed by the company that they signed a contract with.  This has had the unfortunate result of extending many indentureship contracts.\n#250  cycles ago, the Syndicate introduced a rule forbidding surveillance in bathrooms.\n#Relatively recently, following the particularly brutal incident with Crawler Hoon in a Valtay Dungeon, the Syndicate has banned using collected children and pregnant women in the game.\n== Production Companies & Trends==\nThe most recent seasons have been hosted by:\n#Fortent\n#Squim Conglomerate - Dungeon Crawler World: Aryl\n#Borant - Dungeon Crawler World: Earth\n#Valtay - Next Season, TBD\n===The Borant Corporation===\nThe Borant Corporation favors a fantasy-themed 18 Level World Dungeon, and is known for "making the most elaborate, most entertaining dungeons."   Borant is typically selected to host one of every fifteen seasons (with at least seven cycles between Borant-hosted seasons), including Dungeon Crawler World: Earth.\nBorant invests a great deal of time and resources into preparing each dungeon and tailoring it to suit the world it takes place on.  At any given time, five forward teams are deployed to candidate planets, where they study the locals and - when needed - directly influence pop culture to ensure that the inhabitants will understand the game and its notifications when the time comes.  The first prep team arrived on Earth in 1937.  The entire fourth floor took place inside of a living creature that developed a bacterial infection, causing the walls to cave in and sections to fill with gore as crawlers navigated its intestines and organs.\n===The Blood Sultanate of the Naga===\nOver 250 cycles ago, the Blood Sultanate ran the first Crawl to lose money.  They have not financially recovered and have not run a single crawl since.  Part of the extreme expense was that the Blood Sultanate distributed a record-breaking (18) Celestial Loot Boxes over the course of the season, and part was likely due to lawsuits against the Blood Sultanates "acceleration" of celebrated crawler Drakea. \n===Fortent===\nFortent hosted the show two seasons before Earth.  Three dungeon admins died to a single crocodilian crawler when Fortent decided to use their own security force to subdue the crawler, rather than relying on the System AI.\n===The Squim Conglomerate===\nThe Squim Conglomerate prefers battle royale-style fights with a single champion, which is a less profitable format than the World Dungeon.\nThe Squim Conglomerate hosted the last season of Dungeon Crawler World approximately 2.25 Earth years ago on the planet Aryl, which was seeded with a gorilla-like species.  The battle royale took place in a massive multilevel colosseum.  Combatants were broken into groups and told their loved ones would be safe only if they killed each other.  Drick survived a Valtay season on an Iguanoid-seeded world some 400 seasons ago, but Valtay Dungeons are known for being particularly brutal:  \nFor the first few seasons of Dungeon Crawler World, presumably as a tribute to its origins, all contestants started as the Primal race.\nFor more about the history of the crawl, check out A Petite Chronicle of the Crawl: One Ladys Journey into Enlightenment through Knowledge and Scholarship and Three-Beat Poetry by Sydnee, as endorsed by Crawler Carl!\n==Trivia==\n*Several seasons ago, a Dungeon had a level where every weapon found on the floor was possessed by a withering spirit.\n*Also many seasons ago, the entire seventh floor was themed around the Guild of Suffering attempting to raise their god.\n', 'Error Replacement Net': '\nAn Error Replacement Net is a technology that was discoverd by the Mantiss a few days before the start of the crawl. It was designed to make the System AI more stable, or, in the AIs words, to lobotomize them.\n', 'Escape Velocity': '\nThe Escape Velocity was the name of the ship that discoverd the wormwhole to the first system where a scientific crew investigating a primal ship graveyard came accross a bog generation ship.

Once triggered by the Syndicate Council, it destroys the solar systems sun, effectively killing everything and everyone in the solar system.\n==Description==\nAn unknown mechanism using unknown technology, activated by an unknown protocol.  The "failsafe" typically enters discussion around or after the Twelfth Floor Halls of Ascendency, when the System AI begins to "go primal."  Its purpose is appears to be to prevent a rogue AI from infecting the Center System.\n', 'Indigenous Species Protection Act': '\nThe Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act is a Syndicate law.\nSubsection 35, in conjunction with the Transformation must be given the opportunity to reclaim the matter lost in the event.  The "assigned planetary regent" may "choose the manner of this reclamation."  Option 3 is the 18-Level World Dungeon.  Another option is presumably the battle royale aired in other seasons. \nThe law also requires that all remaining matter must be repurposed to create the subterranean World Dungeon. \n== References ==\n\n', 'Macro AI': '\nA Macro AI system is a form of artifical intelligence thats able to alter the enviroment around it when pluged into a Planetry Engine.\nThey were created by the Mantiss when they discovered an AI production facility in their home world and managed to turn it on.

Nobody knowns what they look like or what happened to them except that at one point there was a great war that spanned the galaxy.\nWhen someone comes across an abandoned remnant of their civilization the resident AI if it is still sane usually takes the form of the race of the species that discovered it. Thats why they take the appearance of whoever chooses them.\n', 'Primal engine': '\nA Primal Engine is a planet regulating computer the size of a grain of rice created by the Primals aeons ago.

The volcano contained a six layered magical world but, one day, the great monster killed or transformed 90% of those living in this world by breathing out a poison gas.  \n{{Quote\n| quote = Scolopendras poison cloud was a Nine Tier attack. It attacked you in nine different ways. The lucky ones simply died. The others were transformed, all in different ways.\n-- Tsarina Signet (Book 2, Chapter 8)\n}}\nIn book 3 the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th floors as "The Scolopendra Lair" levels.  \n== Book 4 ==\nIn book 4 we discover that Psamathe from the nothing. The College told him to use the Psamathe back into the nothing. Ghazis ex-girlfriend Tish tells him that Scolopendra will never be defeated now as the college needed "that artifact".   \nLater in book 4 we have some speculation from Priestly, Author of the 14th edition of The Dungeon Anarchists Cookbook, in relation to the city of Larracos:\n"I still dont fully understand the fable with the volcano and the centipede at the bottom... My culture has a story of a people who built a tower to reach the gods before the gods struck it down and scattered them all. I believe that legend is what this city represents. \nThe Semeru were attempting to reach the Celestials who live not above, but below them. This action somehow awakened Scolopendra at the very base of the volcano" -- Crawler Priestly (Book 4, Chapter 33)\n\n== Book 5 ==\nEarly in Book 5 we have a passage from The hunting grounds:\n"This world, according to the story, was half metropolis and half jungle before Scolopendras nine-tier attack,whatever that even means. After the attack, most everyone died, and the jungle ran rampant, swallowing the ruins. However, after a few hundrend years, the survivors have started to rebuild." -- Crawler Forkith (Book 5, Chapter 5)\n\nThe bugbears, elves. He also mentions that dinosaur-class monsters didnt exist in the area before the nine-tier attack. We later discover that the dinosaurs are transformed Ursine.\nQueen Imogens attack were mostly unaffected by the Nine Tier attack. He thinks this is because the Transfiguration spell making up one of the Tiers was the same one that Imogen had previously used on them. He describes two of the other tiers as spores and a rage spell.  \nWhen elves coped with Scolopendras attack, Clint explains that they hid in their castle, protected by something that they had stolen. He says that they stole soul gems from Scolopendra while she slept and that, as she was waking, they stole something else which protected them from her multi-attack. \nWithin the  elf castle Carl comments on a giant mosaic featuring a glittering black and gold cave dotted with sparkling crystals like the inside of a geode. In the center is a curled up black centipede whose form is continually twisting like a hypnotic spiral. From the center of the mosaic sprouts a white tree which Scolopendra appears to be trying to strangle. \nAn unknown voice says:\n"This is a depiction of Scolapendra. Shes dreaming. Its said when she finally awakens, she will destroy everything and free us all." -- Unknown (Book 5, Chapter 66)\n\nA few chapters later soul crystals saying that they are mined from Scolopendras lair after being created when certain types of people die and have their souls filtered through Scolopendras body. memorial crystals, he says, are similar but are created fallen gods or demigods. \nNear the end of the book its revealed that Pony specifically wants the memorial crystal to protect himself from Scolapendras attacks so that he can defeat her. \n== Book 6 ==\nIn the introduction to book 5 dungeon. \nLater the System AI talks about the The Reminiscence Hydra of Malicious Compliance. In the very early days of the Dungeon Crawler World, larger versions of the Hydra were the final boss of the Dungeon and they were known as Scolapendra Nymphs. He then says that this name is not entirely accurate, heavily implying that it is somewhat accurate. \nIn a passage by Ysalte aka The Downward Spiral/The Inevitable/the Vinegar Bitch:\n"Some say she is the reason for Scolopendras nine-tier attack. Ive heard one dwarf say she is the daughter of the great centipede. Another say shes the sister. Another claimed shes the mother. I doubt any of those are true." -- Allister (Book 6, Chapter 64)\n\nIn the closing passages of the book The Scavenger’s Daughter patch when its fully charged was not an aardvark as she had supposed:\n"Its a giant dentipede! The image is of a centipede crawling through all the skulls! Its disgusting!" -- Donut (Book 6, Chapter 72)\n\n== Speculation ==\nIts likely that "the artifact" Tish said is needed to defeat Scolopendra is the Gate of the Feral Gods.    \nIts very likely that the "something else" the high elves stole, which protected them from the Nine Tier attack, would have been the Memorial Crystal.\n\n'}{'Borant Corporation': 'The Borant Corporation is the company that runs the current version of Dungeon Crawler World.

Elites are powerful, one-of-a-kind entities. These are the non-boss, non-divine hero class of Dungeon Crawler World. If you come across one of these egomaniacs, they will either want to fuck you or kill you. Either way, they will always want to use you. They tend to think this while production is all about them. Be careful. Where theres one elite, theres usually more.\n== Known Elites ==\n* Tsarina Signet\n', 'Game Guide': 'Game Guides are noncombatant NPCs who serve as guildmasters of Tutorial Guild Halls on the first, second, and third floors of the Dungeon.    They are typically former crawlers who took indentured servitude "deals" to exit previous Dungeons sponsored by the host company, and the current season only counts against their indentureship if one of their crawlers reaches the Fourth Floor.    \nWhen a crawler meets a guildmaster, the infobox pop-up provides the guildmasters name, race, class, level, and the description, formatted as:   \nMordecai – Rat Hooligan. Level 50.Guildmaster of this guildhall.This is a Non-Combatant NPC.\nGame Guides can be permanently killed in the Dungeon and tend to stay in safe rooms.\n==Responsibilities==\nAs guildmasters, they are responsible for teaching new crawlers how to use their HUD and Crawler Menus during the tutorial.  Once a guildmaster successfully trains a new crawler, the guildmaster is registered as that crawlers game guide.  Any time the crawler enters a training guild on the first three floors, the crawler will be transported to their game guides guild.   \nGame Guides have access to the codex, but do not have access to the chat feature.  They cannot be watched by live viewers.   They are able to share limited information about the Dungeon, but are restricted by a specific set of rules to prevent cheating.\nBeginning halfway through the Second Floor, Game Guides may begin instructing Crawlers about the Third Floor and race and class selection.  On the Third Floor, Game Guides must help crawlers through class and race selection without overtly telling them what to do. Crawlers lose access to their Game Guides as soon as they reach the Fourth Floor.\n==Preparations==\nGuildmasters spend years preparing for each new season of Transformation pages), the advance teams arrived on Earth in 1937 and Mordecai began the prep phase in 1964.  Preparations include consuming popular media and learning the planets customs.  In previous years, Guildmasters received a newsletter every few cycles; however, Borant Corporation discontinued the newsletter to cut costs and did not notify Guildmasters that the season was opening two years early.“Guildmasters prepare for years for each new dungeon world. Kid, I have been preparing for this longer than you have been alive. The advance team arrived in your 1930s, I believe. Whenever that book came out, The Hobbit. I left the last system and entered the prep phase in your year 1964. I know this world and your customs just as well as you do. I even once got to shapeshift into a human and go out into the world. I went to a Blockbuster Video and stole a bunch of James Bond tapes. I was so happy once you guys started digitizing everything.” \n==Notable Game Guides==\n*Mordecai\n*Mistress Tiatha\n*Odette (former)\n', 'Glossary': 'Glossary\n__TOC__\n', 'Guilds': 'Guilds are a Dungeon mechanic introduced on the Sixth Floor that allow separate parties or individuals to team up and share upgrades.\n==Basic Guilds==\nTo start a Guild, a crawler needs to purchase a Guild Charter for 500,000+ gold from a Bopca Protector. \nThe basic level one guild can include up to five separate parties or individuals, as long as at least one member in each Party already owns a Personal Space.  After the guild is formed, a new room labelled Guild Common Area is added to all associated personal spaces.  The crawlers existing personal and party spaces are still restricted to party members only.\n==Guild Leaders / Guildmaster==\nEach Guild has a Guild Leader who controls guild membership and can assign administration rights to members, such as the power to edit the common area or purchase common upgrades.  Guild Leaders may choose to charge membership fees and create a guild treasury.\n==Guild Upgrades==\nGuild upgrades can be purchased.  \n*Most personal space environmental upgrades can be shared with other guild members for a small licensing fee.\n*Guild-wide experience sharing can be purchased.\n== References ==\n\n', 'HUD / Crawler Menu': '\nImmediately upon descending the stairwell to the first floor, all crawlers are equipped with a simple heads-up display (HUD) visual interface.  The HUDs functions are limited until the crawler visits a tutorial training, which gives the crawler access to the expanded HUD and Crawler Menus.     \nThe HUD is always active when the crawler is in the Dungeon unless the Crawler is in the presence of a Dungeon administrator.  In this particular season of Dungeon Crawler World, due to a shoestring budget, crawlers have access to their HUD and menus as long as they are located between the Earths core and sea level.\nVarious elements of the HUD can be upgraded by items, awards, potions, etc. \n== Before the Tutorial==\nError. You may not access this until you have completed the tutorial.After entering the surface stairwells and before entering the Dungeon, crawlers have access to a basic HUD.   A countdown timer to level collapse appears in the upper right corner of the crawlers vision.\n====Minimap Symbols ====\n{| class="fandom-table"\n!Symbol\n!Description\n|-\n|Green Dot \n|self  \n|-\n|Purple Dot\n|Hunters on the sixth floor (presumably will apply to other "tourists" on the 9th floor as well)\n|-\n|Red Dot \n|mobs, bosses, and hostile NPCs \n|-\n|White Dot\n|friendly or nonhostile NPCs \n==The Crawler Menu ==\nYou have been granted access to the Crawler Menu.  It was not introduced during the tutorial.\n===Health Menu===\nWhile the HUD Health Bar is a single green bar, the Health Menu is a more extensive pie chart and indicates any active conditions or debuffs.   \nIn the Dungeon, healing is accelerated.  Health slowly refills based on constitution level, and instantly refills when the crawler enters a stairwell.  (Quadrupeds have a different interface, which allows them to equip items and perform actions like opening doors directly from the menu.)  Unopened Loot Boxes appear in the "Awards and Boxes" tab marked as Ready to Open.   New tabs/submenus appear as items are added, including such tabs as: Healing, History, Pharmaceuticals,  \n===Magic Menu ===\nThe only real description of the Magic Menu is Carls description: "complicated as shit."\nWhen the Dungeon opens, viewers cannot see private chats between crawlers but Borant Corporation and the system AI can.\n==== Chats with Admins ====\nAfter crawlers are entered into the Crawler Assisted Outreach Program and assigned a PR agent, the PR agent can create a special chat in the Messaging Menu.  The admin has the ability to close the chat at any time; the chat disappears from the crawlers log, and the crawler cannot respond or open a new chat with the admin. \n==== Chats with NPCs ====\nManagers have private, protected chats with their crawlers, which are not accessible to viewers.  Sentient NPCs, including those currently employed in clubs such as the Desperado Club, can also communicate by chat. \n==== Quest Chats ====\nAll crawlers engaged in a group quest are lumped into a Quest Chat, which - similar to Discord - lists all participants on one side of the screen.\n==== Scratchpad ====\nThe Messaging Menu contains a scratchpad, which a crawler can copy and paste items onto or simply record thoughts in.  \n===Party Menu===\nNew Crawlers are automatically grouped into a "party" with anyone who entered the Dungeon at the same time and place as them. The party member with the highest combined stat total is designated as party leader and given more control over the party menu. \nWhen a crawler first begins to use the group chat, a virtual keyboard materializes in front of them; however, most crawlers soon learn that they can simply focus on the chat window and think the words they want to send.  If two party members are split up, and one is locked into a boss battle, they cannot use the Party Chat to communicate with each other until after the battle is over.  \n===Pet Menu===\nThe Pet Menu is unlocked after the crawler tames a pet, and its dot turns orange.  The crawler can change the pets name and title,\n===Player Stats===\nThe Player Stats menu allows Crawlers to view their current stats: \n*Strength:\n*Intelligence:\n*Constitution:\n*Dexterity:\n*Charisma:\nThe typical adult human averages between 3 and 5 in each of these stats when they enter the Dungeon, but may score outside of this range.  Crawlers will receive (3) stat points every time they level up, but cannot distribute these stat points until they choose a race and class on the third floor.\nSkills can be taught or trained in guildhalls scattered throughout the dungeon, or by equipment, potions (such as Legendary Skill Potions), or spells.  It is relatively easy to train most skills to level 10 or 11, but the more advanced levels are a slog to train.  Most skills cap out at level 15.  The crawlers race or class can unlock the ability to train certain skills up to level 20.\n=== Sponsorship Tab ===\nUnlocked after sponsorship bidding concludes on the fourth floor.   \n=== Third-Party Upgrades ===\nUnlocked by installing upgrades created outside the dungeon, such as a Valtay Corporation Neural Enhancer.  Upgrades recorded in this tab do not include much information aside from the status, such as "This upgrade is working properly." Warning: All communication-based upgrades will be disabled while you are within the dungeon. Any attempts to circumvent dungeon security will result in immediate disqualification. \n', 'Loot Boxes': '{{Item|title=Loot Boxes|type=Dungeon Mechanic|effects=+ semi-random  loot|source=Achievements\nFans \nSponsors|buy=Not Eligible|sell=Not Eligible}}\nLoot Boxes are generally distributed to crawlers by the type of loot box a crawler receives is tailored to the achievement, and the semi-randomly generated loot is influenced by the boxs type.  Special boxes may be ordered by the crawlers fans or patrons. \n==Tiers==\nThere are six tiers of Loot Boxes.  A lower tier loot box will contain common or unenchanted items, whereas higher tier boxes contain more powerful and rare loot. The tiers are (in order of lowest to highest):   \n#Bronze\n#Silver\n#Gold\n#Platinum\n#Legendary\n#Celestial\nThe host company pays taxes to the Syndicate on the tier of every non-sponsored box distributed in game.  As a result, only 2,145 Celestial Boxes of any kind have been awarded in the history of Dungeon Crawler World.  No crawler has ever received more than four Celestial Boxes, and no more than (18) have been distributed during a single season.  \nBenefactor/Sponsorship Boxes are purchased at great expense by a crawlers patrons/sponsors, with the cost increasing with the boxs tier.  They often contain stronger equipment and items, and may include items from the sponsors homeworld or other items or equipment that do not match the dungeons match.  In general, a Bronze Benefactor box is better than a Gold Adventurer Box.  The crawler may also receive loot can be used by their race but not by their class; so a barbarian may end up with a necromancers staff.  All loot gained from Loot Boxes (with the exception of Benefactor Boxes) will fit the Borants fantasy-themed dungeon will find "a pulse rifle or automated power armor" when opening one.  As Mordecai emphasizes, "Always read the descriptions before you activate or wear something. Always, always. No exceptions."\n==Opening Loot Boxes==\nAfter completing the Tutorial Guild, crawlers can access unopened Loot Boxes through the "Awards and Boxes" tab of their Inventory Crawler Menu.  Unopened boxes cannot be sold or transferred.\nLoot Boxes can only be opened in Safe Rooms and most be opened all at once; the crawler cannot pick and choose boxes, or stop before all boxes are opened.  The boxes float out of the crawlers inventory and line up in front of the crawler by tier, from Bronze to Celestial, before opening one by one: the top pops open, the box disappears in a puff of smoke, and the items appear on the ground and then are automatically deposited into the Crawlers inventory. \n', 'Pets & Dungeon Familiars': 'Crawlers may be accompanied by pets or by dungeon familiars.\n==Dungeon Familiars==\nDungeon familiars entered the Dungeon from the surface and were assigned crawler IDs (e.g. Donut and Cici).   They did not meet the minimum required intelligence of 2 to complete the tutorial, so they were classified as "pets" by the System AI.\nDungeon familiars do not count as "crawler pets," but most pet rules appear to apply.  The most notable exception is quantity; a crawler can have an unlimited number of dungeon familiars.   \nPets can be equipped with gear, armor, or magical items, and may be able to learn spells.  If a pet kills a dungeon boss or another crawler, they do not receive stars or player skulls beside their names; it is possible but not confirmed that their owner receives the mark instead.\n=== Pet Menu ===\nThe Pet Menu allows a crawler to change the pets name and title, and view the pets stats, abilities, and health.  If the crawler and pet-class mob do not bond before the floor collapses, the crawler will have to leave the pet behind.\n', 'Prize Carousel': '\n{{Quote\n| quote = Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time for your favorite segment of Dungeon Crawler World. The Prize Carousel!\n-- Book 3, Chapter 7\n}}\nThe Prize Carousel is a time-restricted Dungeon minigame hosted by Chaco.  Crawlers can receive the ability to "play" if their fans select it as a Fan Box reward, but it is not particularly popular and only happens a few times each season.\n== Description ==\nHeralded by colored lights and cheesy 1970s game show music, the Prize Carousel is a spinning, twinkling carousel that appears in the crawlers safe room after the Fan Box is opened.  It has nine curtained-off sections containing nine prizes.\nThe crawler has ten minutes to select a prize, but is not able to scan the items or view tooltip descriptions of the items. \n== Carls Experience ==\nCarl receives this prize from a Platinum Fan Box on the  fourth floor, and suspects that his fans voted for it specifically because of Mordecai and Chacos strained relationship.\n{| class="fandom-table plainrowheaders" style="width:100%"\n|+ Carls Options\n! 1\n|Two Potions\n|Fizzy, dark blue potions that may be skill potions.\n|-\n!2\n|500 Bomb  \n| a pyramid of hob-lobbers, shiny as though coated in tar\n|-\n!3\n| 2000 Earth Books\n|An assortment of English-language books, including Fifty Shades of Grey and a Canadian phonebook.\n|-\n!4\n|1965 Harley Davidson Motorcycle\n| Red and beige motorcycle that originally belonged to Carls Father\n|-\n!5\n|Best Laid Traps\n|A small, leatherbound, unenchanted book.\n|-\n!6\n|Another book!\n|\n|-\n!7\n|Enchanted Chaps\n|Currently modeled by a mannequin, the dark leather ass-less and crotch-less chaps glow with a green aura.\n|-\n!8\n|Stat Buff Potion\n|Orange and bubbly potion glowing with a twinkling aura.

It is conducted by the Guildmaster of a  Dungeons First, Second, and Third Floors.\n==Overview==\nImmediately after  the Transformation, a surface-level AI announcement introduces the Dungeon as a means to regain control of the planet.  The AI encourages any prospective crawlers to find a Tutorial Guild Hall as soon as they can after entering the Dungeon.\nCrawlers need an Intelligence score of at least 2 to qualify for the tutorial; otherwise, they will not unlock their Menu and will be classified as a pet.  The tutorial takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete.  Afterwards, the Guildmaster who administered the Tutorial becomes the crawlers registered Game Guide.\n===In the Books===\nWhen the tutorial begins, the Guildmasters right hand glows for a moment and the Crawler receives the notification: "You have been granted access to the Crawler Menu."  The crawlers vision blinks and reappears with the expanded HUD.\n===In the Soundbooth Theater Cinematic Audio===\nAlthough the tutorial follows the same general format in Soundbooth Theaters Cinematic Audio series, the tutorial is not guided by the Guildmaster.  Instead, the Guildmaster rolls out an old TV and plays a video narrated by a too-narrow human man who constantly fake-laughs and changes position. Not to break the just-the-facts-maam format of the wiki, but its a fun spin on the tutorial if youre designing a homebrew DCC campaign. \n', 'Tutorial Guild Hall': 'Tutorial Guild Halls are safe rooms unique to the first, second, and third floors of the Guildmasters / Game Guides. \n==AI Notifications==\nTutorial Guild Hall \nThis is a Safe Zone. \nWarning: level timers are still active.Discovering a Tutorial Guild Hall sign unlocks the "Youve discovered and read an official dungeon sign" achievement.  \nEntering the hall unlocks the "Youve entered a guildhall!" achievement.\n== Description ==\nCarl and Princess Donut are only able to access Mordecais Guild Hall.   Mordecais Guild Hall is his personal space.\nOn the first floor, half of the room is dominated by Mordecais bed and a fireplace; the other half of the room contains a worn rug and six classroom chairs.  In the Soundbooth Theater Cinematic Audio, the room also contains an old television, which is used in the tutorial.\nOn the Third Floor, there are also beds in case the crawler decides to make a significant race change. \n'}
