When [[Carl]] was a kid, [[Carl's Father]]'s most prized possession was a red and beige '''1965 Harley Davidson FLH Panhead Electra Glide''' motorcycle with a small dent on the gas tank.

==Story==
The same specific 1965 Harley Davidson motorcycle appears on Chaco's [[Prize Carousel|Prize Carousel]] on the [[Fourth Floor|fourth floor]].  Carl is unable to focus on the other prizes as he remembers how he had slipped on the driveway and accidentally dented the motorcycle's tank, and how his father had lashed him bloody with a belt in retaliation.  Ultimately, Carl selects a different prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = Carl and [[Donut]] find the same motorcycle outside his father's trailer on the [[Eighth Floor]].  The leather seat is cracked and the Georgia plates are years out of date, but the tank is full.  Carl adds both the motorcycle and its keys to his inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref|6|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

'''The 201st Security Group Militia''' is a [[Elf|City Elf]] organisation dedicated to [[Apito|Apito]] the Oak Mother. They run the Apito Education Centre and in their off time double as door guards.

They believed that [[Donut]] is the Oakfel, Apito's version of the Anti-Christ that is prophesied to unravel the heavens and kill all the gods, all because she was wearing the [[Enchanted Anklet of the Fallen Oak]]. They also mistakenly believe the [[Skyfowl]] are angels and worship them accordingly.

They tortured and murdered [[GumGum]] after she investigated the dead prostitutes that started appearing.

An '''Adjutant''' is a neutral third-party consultant and referee for [[Ninth Floor]] Faction Wars teams.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  

== Description ==
Each Faction has an adjutant, who in turn has open communications with other teams' adjutants. Their participation is generally symbolic; they are typically flashy, famous characters like [[Odette]] who are there to give a running commentary to viewers during their daily, on-air recaps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|6|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjutants have access to the expanded ruleset and limited ability to call out rule violations, although their behavior is heavily policed by the [[System AI]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|6|36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are physically on the battlegrounds and can accompany the Warlords into battle, [[Zev]] believes that all adjutants are constantly under an invulnerability spell.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Adjutants must pass a referee exam to be eligible.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

== Known Adjutants (Current, Former, and Aspiring) ==
* [[Baroness Victory]]
* [[Drick]] - aspiring.
* [[Odette]] - former.
* [[Ripper Wonton]]

The Adventurer Box is a common [[:Category:Loot Boxes|loot box]] containing standard adventuring gear.  

Bronze and Silver Adventurer Boxes are liberally distributed on the first two floors, and typically contained potions and bandages.  Beginning on the [[Third Floor|Third]] or [[Fourth Floor]], "low-tier adventurer boxes" also began to include gold coins, clothing items, and unenchanted weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[Fifth Floor]], [[Carl]] begins receiving hobgoblin dynamite and "[[Good Healing Potions]]" instead of standard potions in low-tier adventurer boxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (chapter 28).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Bronze Adventurer Box==
Bronze-colored and about half the size of a military foot locker, Bronze Adventurer Boxes are a common award for achievements.  They typically contain two line items of loot.

===Sample Loot===
* Common Fingerless Gloves&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 5).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cowboy Hat&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 25).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Healing Potion|Potion of Healing]] x 1 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Healing Potion|Potion of Healing]] x 2 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Potion of Mana]] / Mana Restoration Potion
*Torch (item, not spell)
*Bandages, which stop '''bleed''' effect.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt.  ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 25).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related Achievements===

*[[Empty Pockets|Empty pockets!]]
*[[You’ve killed a mob a higher level than yourself!|You've killed a mob a higher level than yourself!]]
*[[Oooh, Magic|Oooh, Magic!]]

*unnamed achievement for sharing experience&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Silver Adventurer Box==
Slightly larger than the Bronze Box and made of silver, the Silver Adventurer Box is a common award for achievements.   

===Sample Loot === 

*Bracelet of +2 DEX&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*Crawler Biscuit x 100 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*Pet Biscuits x 100 (quantity assumed) &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Poison Antidote x 2 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*Ring of +1 CON&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*[[Magic Missile|Tome of Magic Missile]] &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Torch (item) x 20 &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sample Loot (Floor 5+)===

==Gold Adventurer Box==
'''This section does not contain spoilers for book 6, but may link to pages that do contain spoilers.'''  

Carl does not specifically mention receiving a Gold Adventurer Box until ''[[The Eye of the Bedlam Bride (Book)|The Eye of the Bedlam Bride]]''.  In the same book, Bronze and Silver Adventurer Boxes begin including [[Scroll of Build Trench|Scrolls of Build Trenches]] and [[Size up potion|Size-up Potions]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (chapter 49).&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Sample Loot === 

*[[Good Healing Potion]]
*[[Good Mana Potion]]
*[[Potion of Phase Through Wall]]
*[[Potion of Invisibility|Invisibility Potion]]

==Platinum Adventurer Box==
A Platinum Adventure Box may be received up to (3) times by cashing in [[PVP Coupon|PVP coupons]].&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agatha''' appears to be a homeless human woman pushing a loaded-down shopping cart through the [[Dungeon]].

==Description==
Agatha entered the [[Dungeon]] in Wenatchee, WA, after starting a fire that forced the [[Meadow Lark]] eldercare facility to evacuate.  As a result of the fire, some 250 emergency responders and Meadow Lark staff and residents survived the [[Transformation]] and entered the Dungeon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Agatha refuses to take the [[Tutorial]] or formally join the party, she hangs around the Meadow Lark survivors on the [[First Floor]] and even inserts herself into the Boss Battle against the [[Ball of Swine]].  [[Carl]] takes her shopping cart into his inventory for the duration of the fight. 

Irregularities crop up around her.  She is deliberately edited out of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World: Earth]]'', and the camera feeds glitch when she's around.  She refuses to take the [[Tutorial]] and, as Carl realizes when he examines his Inventory's "History" tab, has a shopping cart full of [[Valtay]] technology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Agatha's skin is deeply wrinkled and her rheumy eyes are black.  She is "wrapped head to toe in an endless amount of scarves," and a red-checkered trapper hat with ear flaps sits askew on her head.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her shopping cart appears to be brimming with blankets, clothing, spray paint, an IKEA bag, and a plastic pink flamingo with an arrow stuck in its head.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The wheel squeaks slightly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==History==
{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = &lt;p&gt;A [[Residual]], Agent 22 peeled away from the collective and traveled to Earth with [[Alexandro | Agent 21]] ten years ago. She killed an [[Apothecary]] residual already on earth and assumed control of its body to secure access to the Apothecary's information feeds and equipment. For years now, she has gone by her human name, "Agatha."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|6|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agatha had planned to reach Seattle before the Transformation, but lingered in Wenatchee because she liked the Meadow Lark staff. [[Brandon An]] would share his lunch with her on occasion, and [[Chris Andrews]] had tried to bring her inside before the winter storm swept the area.  She sets the fire deliberately to ensure that Meadow Lark vacates the building and a [[Dungeon Entrance]] would populate in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to her fond feelings for Meadow Lark, Agatha's wants to sweep the universe "clean of biological life."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

}}'''Ajib''' is an Earth crawler and presumably a dexterity-themed fighter.  He lost the bottom half of his left leg jumping through the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]] on the [[Fifth Floor]]. 

==Story==
[[Carl]] exchanges fist-bumps with Ajib while in line for Sixth Floor [[Class]] Selection, and offers to build Ajib a prosthetic.  Ajib replies that his team is already on it before hopping away.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akland''' was an accountant and a hunter on the [[Sixth Floor]] Hunting Grounds.

==Description ==
As an accountant for the [[Dream]], Akland worked with soy crop shipping manifests.  When the Dream rented out the [[Fantasy Hunter Camp]] as a sort of employee retreat, he performed well and won a spot in the Dream's [[Ninth Floor | Faction Wars]] army.  The Dream offered him money to participate, and more money to travel down to the Sixth Floor Hunting Grounds and hunt [[Louis]].  Akland claimed to have a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was captured by [[Carl]] and [[Samantha]], and briefly interrogated. Carl marked him with the [[Enchanted Night Wyrm’s Ring of Divine Suffering|Enchanted Night Wyrm's Ring of Divine Suffering]] and killed him, leveling up the ring and boosting Carl to level 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Arrow of Enthusiastic Double Gonorrhea]] x 1

}}{{Item|title=Alchemy Table|type=Crafting Table}}

The '''Alchemy Table''' is a crafting workbench that allows crawlers to transform various Dungeon loot such as organs and skins into potions.  Although the table includes tools and resources, it does not necessarily include recipes.

==Level Up==
At Level 1, the table looks like an ordinary crafting table.  At Level 3, it has expanded to three times its base size and includes a faucet as well as layers of shelves and drawers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alchemy Tables increase one level each time the crawler descends to a new floor.

Alchemy Tables can be specialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref|3|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==Description==
Agent 21 peeled away from the collective and traveled to Earth with [[Agatha]] ten years ago. Like Agatha, they killed an [[The Apothecary|Apothecary]] residual already on earth and assumed control of its body to secure access to the Apothecary's information feeds and equipment. For years now, they have gone by their human name "Parvati." 

Parvati was investigating Borant's mapping activity in Mumbai, India, shortly before the [[The Transformation|transformation]].  They took a significant risk by killing one Borant employee and fully infiltrating another Borant-employed human, assuming the new identity of '''Alexandro'''.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (epilogue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandro is now [[Lucia Mar]]'s [[Youth Assistant|youth assistant]].  When Lucia Mar and Donut fight, he insists that Lucia should kill Donut for the experience points.  Although Lucia tells Donut Alexandro's name and role, this dialogue is omitted from the recap episode.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Butcher's Masquerade'' (chapter 37).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speculation ==

* As a youth assistant, Alexandro is presumably based at the [[Kinder Facility|kinder facility]] in Mumba.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (chapter 19).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alexandro may be messaging Lucia or may be present in the Dungeon; Lucia specifically looks backward when interacting with him while talking to Donut, and appears to be talking to someone behind her shoulder when interacting with Florin and Ifechi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Author of the 13th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]], which appears to him as a T'Ghee deck of cards.

== Cookbook Entries ==
There is no longer a 15-second waiting period for removing items from inventory, so [[Rosetta|this advice]] is mostly moot. I can confirm that backpacks do still maintain stability. They weigh you down, however, and don't work as well as inventory. (Chapter 13, Book 3)

I don't know if this is the cause, but this appears to be [[Batbilge]]'s last entry into the Cookbook. I've been leaving the cards casually on my bed whenever I use the marketplace. Make sure you don't have it on you to be safe. (Chapter 3, Book 4)

[[Vampire|Vampires]]. We have them in my culture, but they are not the same as the ones here in the dungeon, although they are similar. My T'Ghee deck contains two vampiric forms. The Plague Bearer and the Blood Hunter. Both represent death. Both represent the end of days. But one is considered deliberate, thirst-based evil, and the other, the Plague Bearer, is a study on how one='s poor actions can ripple through time and become amplified and doom of all. The vampires here on this seventh floor are a combination of the two. It is strange that our traditions are so different yet the same. I have not met any fellow crawlers cursed with vampirism, but I have met my fair share of vampire mobs and NPCs. The monster ones cannot be reasoned with. They are fast. Faster than you think. They are insatiable. They are strong. Yet they are not mindless. In fact, I believe the curse of vampirism greatly increases their intelligence. They cast spells. They wish to surround themselves with protectors. Do not underestimate them. Do not rely solely on your own mythology to defeat them. My best advice is to avoid them, and if they've moved into an area you occupy, move away as quickly as you can. (Chapter 45, Book 5)

The Semeru Dwarves of the ninth floor all only worship a single [[Ysalte|goddess]], who inevitably makes an appearance near the end of the battles as the final teams approach the gates of the castle of [[Larracos]]. She only has a single temple in the entire dungeon. I have never seen or heard of a crawler worshipping her. I don't know if that's even possible. She is also, apparently, used as a foil during the [[Celestial Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] battles as well. She is hated by both the gods and the demons, and she's said to be forever scheming, moving nations like pieces on a chessboard. Killing and resurrecting, all in her unknown cause. I've heard her described as a trickster. Insane. Jealous of mortals. The dwarves call her the Downward Spiral. An Earth and Water goddess who punishes those who abuse her world and the weakest within it. In my religion, we have a T'Ghee card that represents such a figure, called The Inevitable. Some say she is the reason for [[Scolopendra]]'s nine-tier attack. I've heard one dwarf say she is the daughter of the great centipede. Another say she's the sister. Another claimed she's the mother. I doubt any of those are true. Outside of Larracos, she is known by another name. She is called the Vinegar Bitch. (Chapter 64, Book 6)

'''Alpha Male Carl. Level 69.''' 
&lt;br /&gt;'''Nice.'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description==
Alpha Male Carl is a masculine caricature of [[Carl]].  He has gelled-back hair that [[Donut]] says is better than Carl's, and a prominent bulge in his star-patterned boxers. His War Gauntlet is bone-white rather than black.  His patch jacket has two buttons: "#1 Son" and "Brother of the Century." He speaks in [[Carl's Father]]'s voice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When summoned by the Hydra, he tosses hob-lobbers and follows up the explosions by dancing backward, pumping finger guns, and exclaiming, "Dance, baby!" [[King Croissant]] rides on his shoulder.

She is the founder of the Butcher's Masquerade and created the peace seal that is a part of the party. She delivers invitations to the [[Butcher's Masquerade]]. The grand prize at the Butcher's Masquerade is the Memorial Crystal of Apito. [[Mordecai]] notes that this is strange since a memorial crystal is usually only obtainable for deceased gods, and Apito is not deceased. Carl is given a quest by [[Emberus]] to obtain the Memorial Crystal of Apito. 

She is worshiped by the [[Elves]] who have several stores about her including that to maintain the path to heaven her angels must remain free and alive and that she once called the [[skyfowl]] blessed. Their is also an apocryphal myth that says that only the angels are blessed, that people must stop any violence against angels and if it continues she will destroy all the worlds.

Asojano is the Lord of Smallpox.

[[Carl]], [[Donut]], [[Sister Ines]], [[Anton]] and [[Paz Lo|Paz]] get a quest in which they get the option to repair his shrine, repairing his shrine will not cause him to ascend.

== AI Description ==
{{Character_info|species=[[Orisha]]|first_appearance=Chapter 10, Book 6|level=130}}
'''Asojano - Orisha. Level 130 City Boss. This is a non-corporeal spirit.'''

Also known as the Lord of Smallpox, Asojano is one of the most respected and feared of the Orishas, a former god made flesh upon the rise of the Ascendency.

As the worshippers of these gods grew more and more extinct, their temples crumbled, and the power of these former deities waned. Eventually, they faded into nothing, slipping away beyond the veil, becoming nothing more than any other ghommid, only able to visit the physical world on occasion.

One day, not so long ago, Asojano found himself here in this small town, visiting the world he once helped rule. There was no malice to his actions. He came just so he could look upon what he once had and what he had lost.

Still, power lingers, even in the most forgotten of shells.

Asojano is disease incarnate. He kills, and he heals. He is life, and he is death. He also wears a reed hat that makes it difficult to see where he's going, so he bumps into stuff a lot.

==Description==
You have killed a ranking NPC town official. *Sniff* It seems like just yesterday you were nothing but a scared, level-1 crawler with beautiful feet, pissing yourself as you faced down a rat. Now look at you. You've moved all the way up to political assassinations. What's next? Killing a god? 

''Reward:'' You've received a Bronze [[Assasin's Box|Assassin's Box]]!

Astral Paw is a telekinesis spell that mimics the paw of an animal. At higher levels it becomes a potent attack spell. Obtained by [[Donut]] on [[Fifth Floor|Floor 5]] through her membership to the [[Dungeon Book of the Floor Club]].
==Description==
'''Cost''': unknown

'''Target''': empty space within spell radius, about 10 meters at level 1.

'''Duration''': unknown

Allows the caster to manipulate objects at a distance as if they were touching them with a paw. It can be used as a weapon and is stronger in that regard compared to Astral Hand because it lacks the latter's fine motor control. At level 5, it can grow claws. At level 10, it can be made much larger. At level 15, the caster's skills and abilities are translated directly into the paw.

==Description==
Author of the 17th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
Some NPCs are indestructible. You can kill them, and they regenerate in a matter of minutes. If you find one of those, it means they have something on them or they know something important. Big important. The trick is figuring out what that is. (Chapter 26, Book 3)

This is [[Sinjin]]'s last entry. A person in my party was smote by his god, and it made his blindness debuff permanent. Stay the fuck away from gods. (Chapter 30, Book 4)

Spiders. By the gods, why? In our world, they only exist in myth, but apparently they're a real thing and are common in the universe. What sort of nightmare must the Creators have been having to design such a thing? (Chapter 26, Book 6)

[[Carl]] encounters low level, lava-spitting, meth-dealing '''bad llamas''' on the [[First Floor|first floor]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt.  ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==AI Description==
'''Bad Llama. Level 3.''' 

'''It’s a llama, but it’s bad. If he were human, he’d be covered in prison tattoos and would be hanging out in front of the Circle K hitting on 14-year-old girls. They might be willing to sell you something if you have good stuff to trade.''' 

'''You won’t want to get hit by their spit.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (pp. 72-73; chapter 8). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
With giant yellow buckteeth and tan fur, Bad Llamas are approximately the size of a horse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to the Denver Zoo, regular llamas are characterized by a small head, a split upper lip, large ears, and short tails.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Denver Zoo.  ''Llamas''.  Retrieved from: [https://denverzoo.org/animals/llama/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A pouch in their throats allows them to spit red, baseball-sized gobs of scorching lava-spit from their mouths.  It glows red when they prepare to spit; if the pouch is ruptured during this stage, it will burn the llama's throat and kill it.  The lava spit smells of sulfur and cools from crimson to red.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beginning on the third floor, Bad Llamas may be worshippers of [[Grull]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 25).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dropped Loot ==
On the [[First Floor|first floor]], bad llamas may drop:
* Poor Llama skin
* Uncooked Llama steaks X 2
* Baggie of trailer park-grade meth X 2&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description==
Screw Hadji. Hadji was a little bitch, anyway. You have completed a quest, but it was completed in a way unusual enough to trigger the Bandit Achievement! Unlike the real Bandit, who is usually instrumental in helping Jonny Quest complete his tasks, you didn't actually do anything to deserve this prize. But that's okay because you're still getting it. This is one of the rare achievements that can be rewarded more than once.

''Reward:'' Your Platinum [[Quest Box]] has been upgraded two times to a Celestial Quest Box!

'''Target''': Temporarily Enchant Equipped Item

'''Duration''': 5 minutes + 1 minute per level of spell. Requires 5 minute cooldown.

Adds both fire and electrical damage to any currently-equipped item. May not be cast on flesh. Well, actually it can be cast on (your own) flesh, but I really wouldn’t recommend it. May inflict Burn and Shock on targets.

Can also be used to cook hotdogs and other items.

Author of the 12th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
Be careful with the marketplace interface. It uses a different system to value items than whatever you might have installed in your UI. It tags this tome as a unique, heirloom item, giving it a ridiculous value, something like 50 million gold. Nothing has happened yet, but I am afraid of giving a third party access to my inventory like that. (Chapter 3, Book 4)

}}Beatrice, mostly known as Bea, is [[Carl|Carl's]] ex-girlfriend and the former owner of [[Donut|Princess Donut]].
==Description==
She has thin long straight hair and freckles.

After surviving the collapse her appearance had changed, she had lost weight and looks like she’s aged ten years.

== History ==
Prior to the start of the book she cheated on [[Carl]] with two different men and [[Angel|Angel's]] owner.

Bea was on vacation to the Bahamas at the time of the Collapse. She was on vacation and cheating on [[Carl]] with [[Brad]], after posting a picture of herself and Brad on instergram Carl rung her up and ended their relationship.

After Carl's work mate [[Sally]] sent him a facebook message asking him out for drinks Bea contacted Carl's boss [[Dick]] and asked him to sack her, accusing her of stalking him. Dick agreed in return for a picture of her breasts. Bea and her friends labelled this operation slut stop. She also knew about Carl's half brother [[Asher]] but kept his existence from Carl.

In the epilogue of book 4, ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'', it is revealed that Bea is now living in the ruins of Seattle. She had broken down after posting the photo of herself and [[Brad]], resulting in Carl ending their relationship, and they flew back early. Two bounty hunters, searching for [[Ferdinand]] (Gravy Boat) stumble upon her, Gravy Boat is ultimately taken by [[Odette]] for her own unexplained plans.

It's implied that an unknown [[residual]] saved her by starting a fire outside her hotel just before the collapse.

As of book 5 she now has full citizenship and is no longer on the planet. She appeared on [[Odette|Odette’s]] show but was heavily drugged.

== Trivia ==
She used to watch the teletubbies and cry.

== AI Description ==
The good ol’ Big Boy Blue is the largest of the jellyfish one might find floating around. They’re a little like that guy you used to know in high school who was always wearing either overalls or a jersey of some sort. The dude is like six foot five and pushing 300 pounds when he was a freshman. He always had a crewcut. Dad’s a trucker. Never talks. Never does his homework. He’s just always, you know, kinda there. He doesn’t mean any harm. But he’s so goddamned dumb he does harm anyway if you get in his way. Plus he always has a super-hot girlfriend for some reason, but that has nothing to do with the damn jellyfish. Anyway, you get the point. Harmless as long as you don’t touch them.

Type: Berserking Spell + partial invulnerability.

Target: Self only

Cost: Item based.

Duration: twenty seconds.

Cooldown: Once every 30 hours.

Effect: You ever seen an angry, on-fire weasel tossed into a room full of chickens?

You catch on fire. You are invulnerable to blunt damage. Then you get really angry and kill every goddamn thing in the room. This is a berserking spell. Don’t cast this inside of a Denny’s. Or anywhere near people you like.

== AI Description ==
You’ve been attacked by a fellow crawler in a safe zone, and the system has been forced to save your ass. That usually suggests you’re either really annoying, or you snore.

If this were a prison, you would now be my bitch. Wait…

'''Reward''': Bitches don’t get rewards.

Type: Involuntary Abjuration

Cost: Item Based

Duration: Instantaneous casting. Affected target will suffer the effects of this spell for (30 + [Caster’s Intelligence+Constitution] – [Target’s Intelligence/2]) Seconds.

Cooldown: Once Every Hour

Target: Single target.

Effect: Has the same effect as wearing a shirt for the band Cattle Decapitation to church. Instantly removes target from the blessing of their deity and all associated buffs and effects. Will make it so target is unable to physically enter church or temple while the spell is in effect. Higher levels of this spell increase the possibility of forcing a smite upon the target.

Warning! You probably don’t want to cast this on members of the same religion more than two or three times in a row.

'''Blitz Sticks''' are a common but highly addictive magical hallucinogen.

==AI Description==
'''Blitz Stick.'''

'''It’s like candy, but for your mind. If you eat this, your Intelligence temporarily rises by five points. If you smoke it, there’s a 15% chance your Intelligence will permanently rise by 1.''' 

'''There might be a side effect or two. Or three.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Description==
Blitz sticks look a bit like licorice sticks and, when lit, have a distinct tangy smell like patchouli.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; While smoking a blitz stick, saying ''"show me..."'' can produce a vivid non-existent memory or create a false escapist dream.  The hallucinations are shorter each time the drug is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|epi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are one of the few substances that cannot be counteracted with a [[Rapid Detox Potion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addictive properties of blitz sticks can be treated with an unidentified skin patch, which must be worn for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zev]], who is not a member of the party when [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] first meet her, is later "Re-educated" to bring her into the party.

== AI Description ==
This exclusive class is only available to crawlers who have obtained the Boom! Achievement.

People who actually choose to work with explosives are the craziest bastards around. You excel at making things blow up. And while you’re good at keeping the bombs from going off in your own hands, Bomb Squad Techs still tend to lose both friends and limbs at alarming rates. Luckily this class comes with a benefit that can fix 50% of that problem.

* All explosive-based traps will mark themselves as you approach.
* All armor is 10% more effective.
* The handling of explosives no longer degrades them.
* Automatic +2 to all explosive-based skills.
* +5 [[Bomb Surgeon]] skill
* +2 to Dexterity.
* +2 to Constitution.
* -2 to Intelligence (After all, only dumbasses would choose to do this for a living.)
* Plus the [[Limb Regeneration Benefit]].

This is an Earth Class. As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver Earth Box upon choosing this class.

First appears as private security for Princess Donut and Carl in the [[Desperado Club]]. Later, he is assigned as a mercenary bodyguard in exchange for [[The Gate of the Feral Gods]] at the beginning of Book 5.

As a reward for helping to repaired [[Yemaya]] shrine the goddess teleported him down to the ninth floor after he confessed that he missed his friend [[The Sledge|Sledgy]].

[[File:00092.jpg|thumb|Cave Mudge Bonker]]
Squat grey-skinned, pig-like monster with toothpick legs and a wooden club studded with nails.

== AI Description ==
'''Cave Mudge Bonker. Level 19.'''

In the hierarchy of Cave Mudge society, the Bonker is about as high on the list as a commoner can get. These odd, war-like creatures are said to have once been a star-faring nation, but something happened to cause them to regress back to the stone age. Probably too much reality TV. Don't let those skinny legs fool you. When these guys get to bonkin', they can be pretty darn quick.

== AI Description ==
{{Character_info|species=Dirigible [[Gnome]]|first_appearance=Chapter 16, Book 4|level=5|image1=00581.jpg}}
'''Bonnie - Dirigible Gnome. Juvenile. Level 5.'''

Little Bonnie only loves two things in this world. Her pet pig Sausage and getting what she wants.

The only daughter of [[Commandant Kane]], a case can be made that she's the true leader of the ''Wasteland''. It is said that when Sausage was captured and held as ransom by the Bactrian camels, the young woman threw such an epic temper tantrum that the only thing that calmed her was watching her father order the bombing of the neutral changeling settlement.

That's the rumor, at least. The truth is, nobody knows much about the shy child. As such, do not judge her too harshly. She is but a spoiled, rich kid. If she's evil, she doesn't know any better, If she's not, it's a tragedy that you're probably going to have to kill her.

Life's a bitch.

[[Carl]] earned this achievement on the [[First Floor|first floor]] by causing the [[Goblins|goblin]] Murder Dozer to explode outside [[Mordecai|Mordecai's]] [[Tutorial Guild Hall|Training Guild]].  It is safe to assume that the [[Loot Boxes|loot box]] is themed to the first mob or situation a crawler explodes.

You've caused a wall-shaking explosion within the dungeon! The last time the walls shook like this was when your mom came over for a visit.

Brandon Andrews is described as a "young chubby black guy" and is a caretaker at the [[Meadow Lark]] elderly care center. He, his brother [[Chris Andrews|Chris]], and the other caretakers all evacuate their elderly wards into the dungeon and do everything they can to protect them, getting most as far as the third floor.

==Description==
Brandon is a cheerful talkative person, is good enough at math to help Carl figure several things out on the first couple floors. He also is a big help building the Moab device to escape the Rage Elemental on the second floor. Brandon dies on the third floor defending the remaining members of the Meadow Lark group from a swarm of Mobs. 

Brandon sends Carl a message that Chris wants to join back up with Carl and Donut because they are “aggressive”. Brandon asks Carl to tell Chris he is sorry for fighting and that Brandon loves his brother. These are Brandon’s final words.

      <text bytes="1187" sha1="mgztm9wj0l8brvlk314j1s633ptjhgl" xml:space="preserve">The Butcher's Masquerade is a spell that only the most divine can cast and they can cast it only once in their life. It creates a party and guest list, no one on the guest list can be harmed unless in self defence, the guest list is designed to be as disharmonious as possible. If the party finishes without violence everyone attending gains a boon from [[Apito]]. If someone breaks the peace they are feed into the [[Nothing]]. Different factions are put in different room, guests aren’t allowed to leave their room until the party is over or the peace deal is broken.

The spell has never been successfully completed

There is also a pet show and talent competition.

== History ==
The first masquerade was put on by [[Taranis]] and [[Apito]] for their extended family in the [[Halls of Ascendancy]]. It was called a Masquerade even though they didn't wear masks because they could pretend they were not enemies. [[Yarilo]] was the first to break the peace when he attempted to rape a familiar of one of the other gods, as punishment he was banished to the [[Nothing]]. All the remaining gods thought and murdered each other. Afterwards the party became a ritual.

Carl is the titular protagonist of Dungeon Crawler Carl.
== Description ==
Before entering the [[Dungeon]], Carl was a 27-year-old U.S. Coast Guard Veteran who worked as a Marine Technician "fixing electrical systems for rich assholes and their party boats."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 2). Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  He shared a two-bedroom second floor apartment in Seattle, WA, ~0.5 miles from the coast of the Puget Sound, with his girlfriend [[Beatrice|Bea]] and her award-winning cat [[Donut|Princess Donut the Queen Anne Chonk]].  He hit the gym three times a week&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enjoyed playing Call of Duty on Playstation&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with his friend [[Monobrow Sam]] while Donut sat in his lap.  He survived [[The Transformation|the collapse]] because [[Donut|Princess Donut]] escaped the apartment when he cracked open the window to smoke, and he went outside in only his leather coat, boxers, and Bea's ill-fitting pink croc sandals to search for her.

In the Dungeon, Carl focuses primarily on hand-to-hand combat and explosives.  After reaching the [[Third Floor]], he selects the [[Primal]] race and the unique monk/rogue hybrid class of [[Compensated Anarchist]], which the AI aptly describes as "a trapmaking, bomb-making, social-media dynamo" that "will happily throw a Molotov through a window one moment and step in front of a camera to plead for the violence to stop the next."&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  He takes the bomb-focused [[Agent Provocateur]] specialization on the [[Sixth Floor]]&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Butcher's Masquerade'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Carl is the twenty-fifth holder of the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].

{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler = After the events of the [[Fifth Floor]], Carl is a devotee of [[Emberus]].  This is the highest possible rank a crawler can attain unless they are a Cleric or Paladin class.}}

==Appearance ==
Carl is described as a clean shaven, tall human man with brown hair he keeps trimmed short and "one of those bodies that naturally held muscle well."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Due to the effects of the [[Enchanted Pedicure Kit of the Sylph]], his bare feet are "shiny" and "glittery."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donut describes him as the worst dressed crawler in the dungeon.

==Personality==
Carl is a gruff man who has a strong sense of right and wrong. He also has "grit", refusing to let the system break him. While not charismatic, he is the sort who will assume leadership if nobody else steps up. He is a loyal and trustworthy crawler, willing to take risks if he can help others, which engenders a great deal of loyalty from other crawlers. Many describe him as "crazy" due to the risks he takes and the creative, albeit half-baked, plans he hatches. In book five it is revealed that the “river” Carl feels within his mind was a trait his mother also had, alluding that she too had a streak of mental illness.  

Carl is extremely resourceful, and has a knack for finding and exploiting loopholes.  Although he doesn't view himself as particularly skilled in math, he is able to "fix most anything electrical after studying it for a bit."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

==History==
Carl's mother was 5'10".  His maternal grandfather played center for Oregon State before becoming a prison guard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Carl's father was a linebacker&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  It is revealed throughout the books that Carl was physically and emotionally abused by his father.   

His mother, in an attempt to free Carl from their shared misery attempted to kill both herself and his father and only succeeded in committing suicide, all on Carl’s birthday. He thought he was getting a bike. 

During his time as a coast guardsman for the US Coast Guard, Carl received firearm and hand-to-hand combat training.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ref|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent most of his time aboard a cutter as a Machinery Technician (MK), but was never involved in any real law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  He spent free hours reading and playing ''Pathfinder'' and ''Dungeons and Dragons''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The last time he played D&amp;D was aboard the USCGC ''Stratton''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interior:'' [http://www.erikwilsonartgallery.com/ Erik Wilson]|publisher=Matt Dinniman|pages=362 (Paperback Edition)|isbn=979-8588333764}}'''''Carl's Doomsday Scenario''''' is a fictional LitRPG fantasy adventure novel by Matt Dinniman, and the second installment in the ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' [[:Category:DCC Books|book series]].  It is available in paperback, digital, and audiobook formats. 

== Abbreviated Summary ==
[[Carl]], [[Donut|Princess Donut]], and [[Mongo]] arrive at the Dungeon's [[Third Floor|third floor]], where Mordecai helps the crawlers choose new races and classes.  The floor is a lore-themed level called the Over City, and includes NPCs called "Elites" who are starring in their own Syndicate television shows.  

== Official Summary ==
'''"The training levels have concluded. Now the games may truly begin."'''

The ratings and views are off the chart. The fans just can't get enough. The dungeon gets more dangerous each day. But in a grinder designed to chew up and spit out crawlers by the millions, Carl and Princess Donut must work harder than ever just to survive.

They call it the Over City. A sprawling, once-thriving metropolis devastated by a mysterious calamity. But these streets are far from abandoned. An undead circus trawls the ruins. Murdered prostitutes rain from the sky. An ancient spell is finally ready to reveal its dark purpose.

Carl still has no pants.

They call it Dungeon Crawler World. For Carl and Donut, it's anything but a game.

'''Effect''': When lit and tossed, results in a small explosion, followed by burning splash damage over a wide area. Flames will burn for 15 seconds per level of attacker’s level of Incendiary Device Handling.

'''Status''': Inert until torch is activated.

'''Description:''' Created by an unstable, pantsless man who talks to a cat, Carl’s Jug O’ Boom takes the bigger-is-better approach when it comes to hobgoblin fire bottles. Burns hotter, bigger, and faster than your normal Molotov Cocktail. The use of a standard torch instead of a cloth wick makes these devices much more stable. Just don’t drop it once it’s lit, lest you find yourself doing a Joan of Arc impersonation.

Carl's Jug O' Boom is created by inserting a Torch into a jug of [[Rev-Up Toilet-Grade Moonshine|Rev-Up Moonshine]]. Creating this device earned Carl the [[Dungeonpreneur]] achievement&lt;ref&gt;Page 306 Book 1&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The recipe for Jug O' Boom was featured on the recap episode and added to the Dungeon Codex. Carl will receive one gold coin for every kill with this device by other crawlers. Two gold plus a 25% fee, rounded up, is deducted upon cash out. Royalties from this recipe indicate that at least one other crawler has access to [[Rev-Up Toilet-Grade Moonshine|Rev-Up Moonshine]] and has used it to craft this recipe .

== Description ==
A wicker-like scoop, two feet long, that [[Carl]] can attach to his hand and arm. It is used for throwing projectiles with high speed and accuracy. When Carl summons something from his inventory into his hand it goes right into the scoop, which adjusts itself to accommodate the projectile. He typically uses it to throw bombs or potions held in delivery devices fashioned by [[Mordecai]].  Carl has a lot of range with the xistera, and his accuracy is very good except at the longest distances, where he will often overshoot his target. When not in use the xistera can fold inward onto Carl's forearm and form a bracer, which leaves his hand free and allows him to summon his gauntlet.

Carl got the xistera from his first fan box. The Cesta Punta skill he got from his Earth Hobby Potion gives him instinctive knowledge of how to use it, which is why his fans chose it for him. It was also much cooler than the slingshot he had been trying to use.

== Enchanted Xistera Extension Slot (Head-throwing attachment) ==
This is a unique item!

This item was created especially for Crawler Carl by The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network, Intergalactic NFC.

Attaches to the end of a xistera. Allows for the tossing of a head.

This special edition head tosser is custom made to fit decapitated love doll heads.

When tossing a head of a withering spirit, the distance traveled will be greatly enhanced. (500 meters x Strength.)

Tossed head will be magically returned once the extension slot is removed from xistera.

This item bears an inscription that reads "Made for Crawler Carl by the Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network, Intergalactic NFC with design approval by CEO and president of Outreach Operations, [[Porthus|Dr. P. Hu.]]"

'''Cascadia''' is the lead engineer and current executive producer of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]: Earth''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|6|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She makes the overly enthusiastic daily announcements.

==Description==
Cascadia is recently divorced, a [[Kua-tin]] member of [[The Bloom]], and a [[Borant Corporation]] employee.  As the lead engineer and executive producer of this season's crawl, she is responsible for managing the Dungeon and coordinating the Faction Wars.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  [[Zev]] reports to her.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

She spent years designing the [[Seventh Floor | Great Race]].  

==Appearance==
A small kua-tin, Cascadia has long, droopy, catfish-like whiskers.  Her scales have a dull sheen, and - when necessary - she wears a rebreather over her gills.  She smells a little bit like the whitefish and spinach-flavored cat food [[Donut]] used to eat on Earth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Although Cascadia comes across as overly perky and enthusiastic during her daily announcements, [[Prepotente]] describes Cascadia as "a nasty little woman who thinks she's smarter than everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spoiler | book = 6 | spoiler = As the [[Ninth Floor | Faction Wars]] approach, she is increasingly overwhelmed and stressed; as she says, "I am on a tight schedule and am one crisis shy of pulling the failsafe, which would kill us all."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same scene, she physically appears in [[Carl]]'s space and dares him to attack her.}}

==Description==
This is the primary skill of Donut's [[Former Child Actor]] class. Every floor she chooses a class and receives a random selection of that class's benefits and abilities. The quality of the roll scales with level, which only increases when going down to the next floor. It starts at level 3 on floor 3, so the base level is always equal to the floor number. In the beginning she hardly gets anything with her choice, but with each floor she gets progressively more of the benefits and abilities. When she exits the floor, she loses the benefits and abilities granted by the class and must select a new one. 

A hidden side effect of this skill is it's actually possible for Donut to retain any of the abilities granted to her by her temporary class as long as she gained a level in it. Instead of the skill itself being removed, only the levels granted by the class are removed. She keeps the levels she gained and her experience is redistributed. So a skill that might have started at 5 and increased to level 7 on a floor will end up being something like level 4 once the original 5 levels are removed. However, a skill that was not leveled at least once will be lost at the end of the floor when all its levels are removed. 

In addition, as Donut gets stronger she fulfills the prerequisites of increasingly rare and powerful classes, giving her access to a progressively better selection of options each floor.

On floor 6, Donut received all of the starting skills of her class plus some upgrades.
==Donut's Classes==
These are the classes Donut has chosen on each floor:
*[[Artist Alley Mogul]]
*[[Football Hooligan]]
*[[Glass Cannon]]
*[[Legendary Diva]]
*[[Viper Queen]]
*[[Master Telephone Psychic]]

}}Chris Andrews is a caretaker at the Meadow Lark elderly care center. He, his brother [[Brandon An]], and the other caretakers all evacuate their elderly wards into the dungeon and do everything they can to protect them, getting most as far as the third floor.

==Description==
Chris doesn’t talk much during the first two floors, but according to his brother “there’s nothing wrong with him, he just don’t say much.” Apparently even their mother thought Chris was ‘slow’. 
{{Spoiler

Brandon asks Carl to tell Chris he is sorry for fighting and that Brandon loves his brother. These are Brandon’s final words.

Circe Took is of the mantis race. She is a minor hive queen. She is the mother of Hunters [[Vrah]] and [[Xindy]]. Carl meets her at CrawlCon! where she is the moderator of the Crawling Through the Ages panel. Circe is enraged with Carl for killing her daughter Xindy and is further enraged by Carl promising to kill her other daughter Vrah. She later managed to sue let the hunters leave early, arguing that now [[Borant]] was no longer running the show their contracts were no longer binding.  

Circe sponsors the god [[Diwata]] during the 6th floor so she can cure Vrah of her Enthusiastic Double Gonorrhea.

Crocodilians are an intelligent, thick-skinned, semi-aquatic race.

They are inclined to work as muscle or enforcers for both legitimate and not-so-legitimate organizations throughout the universe.

      <text bytes="2875" sha1="rdobcgtxyd5tz4ffuotrciuok8j61eo" xml:space="preserve">'''Crawler Classes''' define and shape a crawler's skillset as they advance through the [[Dungeon]].  Crawlers select classes on the third floor, and may have the option to further specialize their classes on the sixth, ninth, and twelfth floors. 

==3rd Floor Class Selection==
Upon arriving on the [[Third Floor]], all crawlers must choose a Race and then a Class.  

The [[System AI]] prepares a list of 30+ Class options for each crawler based on their stats, race selection, [[Desperado Club|Desperado]] or [[Club Vanquisher|Vanquisher]] membership if applicable, certain gear items (such as the [[Enchanted Crown of the Sepsis Whore|Crown of the Sepsis Whore]]), and other choices made on the tutorial levels.  The System AI also recommends three Class options to each crawler, but the crawler -- aided by their [[Game Guide]] -- may decide not to select one of these options.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|2|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Base classes such as ''Bard, Magic User, Necromancer, Rogue, Warlock,'' and ''Boring Ol' Fighter'' are available, but there are also more specialized subclasses: ''Jack-of-all-Trades, Wind Mage, NecroBard, Compensated Anarchist'', etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each class includes various benefits, which may or may not include: new skills and spells, the ability to train specific skills or spells beyond level 15, experience/mana point buffs or debuffs, immunity to specific effects, stat point bonuses or penalties, club memberships, etc.

=== Earth Classes ===
'''Earth Classes''' are specialized classes inspired by Earth culture. Crawlers who select an Earth Class receive a Silver [[Earth Box]] containing an [[Earth Hobby Potion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==6th Floor Class Specialization==
After arriving on the Sixth Floor, all remaining crawlers are ushered through a Staging Area and into a small room, where they are given 10 minutes to make a decision.  They do not have access to chat features.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|5|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a class chosen on the 3rd Floor specified that it would be specialized on the sixth floor, the crawler must choose between 3+ new subclasses.  The crawler's "class" name will change.  Some of these subclasses may be further expanded on the ninth and twelfth floors, so it is technically possible for a magic user to specialize in all four elements and create a "four seasons build;" however, this has never been accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorsements ===
If a crawler has a class that cannot be specialized on the sixth floor, they may have the option to choose one of three '''"endorsements."'''  Picking an endorsement does not change the crawler's class.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Character_info|class=[[Light Recon Specialist]]|species=[[Chee]] {{!}} [[Were-kin]]|first_appearance=Chapter 13, Book 5|allies=[[Tsarina Signet]]}}
'''Clint Smashgrab. Level 50. Were-Kin. Light Recon Specialist'''

A long time ago, Clint and his people were of a race called the Chee. They were peaceful. Carpenters, mostly. But then the High Elves wanted their land, and that was that. What happened to them next is a pretty awful story.

There are no Chee left in this realm. There are survivors of that night, when the High-Elves invaded their land. But there are no Chee.

So I'm going to assume you know what a werewolf is. This isn't a werewolf. Or maybe it is. It's a were-kin. That's all you know until either he tells you what he turns into, or he bites you, and you find out for yourself.

Clint and his brothers have joined forces with Tsarina Signet. They have a common enemy.

Clockwork Triplicate is a utility spell that creates duplicates of a pet or minion. Obtained by [[Donut]] on [[The Overcity|Floor3 ]] through her membership to the [[Dungeon Book of the Floor Club]].
==Description==
'''Cost''': 26 mp

'''Target''': Pets and minions controlled by the caster

'''Duration''': 1 minute per spell level

Creates two clockwork duplicates of the target. When the spell is cast, the target appears to split into three. The duplicates look and behave the same as the target but act independently. The system does not identify which one is real. When the spell ends, the replicas break into gears and servos and electric parts that disintegrate into a little pile of ash .

If something else cancels the spell prematurely, the replicas explode in a shower of parts that can cause minor damage.

'''Level 5 Upgrade''': Duration increases to 2 minutes per spell level

'''Club Vanquisher''' is one of two [[Dungeon]]-based clubs that crawlers can join starting in the Over City on the [[Third Floor]]. Similar to the Desperado Club, it includes a marketplace called "Comforting Supplies" and access to various guilds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Its members consist predominantly of clerics and paladins, who have to pick a god after selecting their class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Entering Club Vanquisher. Members Only.'''
&lt;br /&gt;'''Heathens will find no solace here.'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|6|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Club Vanquisher membership is marked by a '''Club Vanquisher Ring.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is not clear how membership is obtained without selecting a god, but a few gods and bard classes allow crawlers to access both the Desperado Club and Club Vanquisher.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In towns, Club Vanquisher typically located in temples and marked by a spire.  Its interior is clean, with colorful stained glass windows and soft, ethereal music. The entrance may be guarded by robed Warrior Clerics.  Its full-time staff includes healers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Defiling or defying Club Vanquisher will compel the club to put a "Holy Crusade Bounty" on a crawler's head.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Story==
{{Spoiler
| book = 4
| spoiler = [[Miriam Dom]]'s membership is revoked on the [[Fifth Floor]] after she is turned into a [[Vampire]].  Furious, [[Prepotenten]] unleashes [[Bianca]] in the main lounge, and she eats a number of clerics.  The Club puts a '''Holy Crusade Bounty''' on the crawlers, and closes down to be "cleansed."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl gains "Free access*" to Club Vanquisher as a result of choosing to worship [[Emberus]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Who fucking cares? You get the reward they were promised! Warning: You may only receive this award once. The next time you do it, we tell them who you are. And then they get a new quest to kill you.

This skill is one of the benefits of Donut's [[Former Child Actor]] class.
==Mordecai's Description==
"Basically, it gives a chance to survive a fatal attack. At level five she's guaranteed one free lethal hit a fight, though she'd be near death afterward. At level ten, your health doesn't go down at all after the first fatal strike. The problem is, the only way to train the skill is by using it. Or with potions, or a training guild if you can find one, but that can get expensive."

A magical sheet of paper, a quill pen, and a little capped jar filled with black ink.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (chapter 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI Description==
'''Coffee Shop Author Kit.''' 

'''Alcoholism and crippling self-doubt not included.''' 

'''So you want to be a writer. It started with sappy poetry in middle school. You soon graduated to Naruto fan-fiction. By the time you crash landed face-first into adulthood, your brain swelled with the misguided notion that your shitty novel with a self-insert protagonist sporting a traumatic childhood would change the world. Spoiler alert. Nobody is going to read your autobiography disguised as a space vampire and minotaur romance. You and every other half-wit out there with a nearby Starbucks and a laptop is writing the same bile. What you’re really doing is inadvertently live-blogging the story of human mediocrity, and the universe is now a better place that the Syndicate has put a stop to it all.''' 

'''Anyway, this is a magical sheet of paper. You will find you now have a second tab on your scratchpad in your interface. You can write something on this paper, and it will appear in the scratchpad and vice versa. If the proper spell and glyphs are accurately copied onto this paper, you can present the sheet at a market kiosk, and a scroll will appear for sale. Or if you have a printing press, you can make your own scrolls. Or even your own tome if you think you have the chops.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (pp. 199-200; chapter 13). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Typically used by scholar and arcanist classes with skills related to scroll making, the Coffee Shop Author Kit allows users to copy information from a second page of their scratchpad onto the magical paper and vice versa.  When transcribed correctly, a spell or glyph can be classified as a "scroll" and sold at the market kiosk.  The greatest benefit is that you can transcribe a spell from your scratchpad onto an unlimited number of scrolls using a printing press table.  If you use the same scroll more than 200 times, you learn the spell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Obtained by [[Carl]] on the [[The Fourth Floor|fourth floor]] from a [[Makeup Sex is the Best Sex Box|Makeup Sex is the Best Sex]] box. He left it in the toilet where no one can see them and used it as a secret way to communicate with the other team members.

This is [[Carl|Carl's]] primary Class.

== AI Description ==
This rare and exclusive class is only available to crawlers who have obtained Level five in the Explosives Handling skill and have received at least 500 Billion views by the time they’ve reached the third floor.

When the oligarchs want to manufacture a social movement, or better yet, stop one in its tracks, they must first bring in the big guns. The paid protestors. The Agent Provocateur. This Monk/Rogue hybrid class is a trapmaking, bomb-making, social-media dynamo. The Compensated Anarchist will happily throw a Molotov through a window one moment and step in front of a camera to plead for the violence to stop the next. Experts in hand-to-hand and dirty tactics, the Compensated Anarchist only suffers when it comes to more traditional fighting techniques.

* +1 to the [[Bomb Surgeon Skill]]
* +1 to the Trap Engineer Skill
* +1 to Unarmed Combat Skill
* -25% Damage when using bladed weapons
* +25% Mana cost for damage-dealing spells
* +5% skill progression speed in all trap-making and bomb-making skills.
* + 2 Hide in Shadows Skill
* + [[Fear]] spell
* + 1 Intelligence
* + 5 Charisma
* +5 to the Find Trap Skill
* +5 to the [[Backfire Skill]]
* +5 to the [[Escape Plan Skill]]
* Access to the [[Desperado Club]] (already obtained)
* Access to the [[Naughty Boys Employment Agency]]

This is an Earth Class. As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver Earth Box upon choosing this class.

== Subclasses ==
Compensated Anarchists must choose a subclass upon descent to the sixth floor.
* [[Agent Provocateur]]
* [[Guerilla]]
* [[Revolutionary]]

== AI Description ==
These psychos are of the bite-first, ask-questions-later school of underwater diplomacy.

Also known as the “Death’s Welcoming Committee Shark,” the Concierge Shark is one of the fastest and most voracious of the ocean’s predators. They’ll eat anything. ANYTHING. Even those circus peanut candy things. It’s really kind of gross.

They are attracted to the scent of blood, making them the most common death dealers of any water-themed dungeon.

== Description ==
Author of the 19th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].

== Cookbook Entries ==
There are three types of deity summonings. Avoid all three. Only idiots deal with deities. Some of them are genuine NPCs, but the big ones like [[Apito]] and [[Eris]] and so forth are always sponsored by some rich prick who basically paid extra to play a game called the [[Celestial Ascendancy]]. The game is contained on the 12th floor, but the individual gods sometimes get called away. That game is different than the [[Ninth Floor|faction wars]] game and has its own followers and storyline. I don't really understand, but I do know this. The gods are invulnerable except on the 12th and above floors. They are strong. They kill everything. And there ain't a damn thing you can do about it. Anyway, the three types of summonings. All three require a physical vessel. Usually a mob. There are celestial boons, which is when a worshipper prays to a god, and he comes to fight for his worshipper. There are indentured summonings, where a powerful mage summons the deity to fight for him for a short time. This is against the god's will, and they are usually pissed when it happens. And finally there are involuntary summonings. That's when some poor fool accidentally summons the god because of some trap or spell or just bad luck. The gods are usually pissed about this one, too, and what's worse, they arrive untethered, which allows them to smash everything in sight. In my short experience, all three scenarios lead to the summoner's death. Even the first scenario. Don't trust deities under any circumstances. Just stay the fuck away. That's my advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I went on a program tonight. They transported me to a ship that floats in low orbit over the planet. The ship has an open window with no glass that is only protected by a forcefield. It is amazing. I can look down upon my planet. My beautiful, lost planet. If I am to die here, I want this to be my last view.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

I am going on another program tonight. I have secreted bugbear paste into my boots. I will detonate them while I am in orbit. There will be two admins on board. My [[Blast Shield]] skill should protect me from the explosion - if the skill works at all in that place. I don't even know. But if I blow the ship, it won't matter. Think of me, brothers. It is little, but it is all I have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

I have failed. I have blown the ship, and my skill indeed protected me, but the forcefield around the ship has prevented it from fully breaking apart. The admins only appeared to be with me. They were holos. I was fooled today, and I am ashamed, brothers. The gravity has failed, the temperature is dropping, and it is getting difficult to breathe. I do not think they can remove me while the forcefield remains. But I see my planet, my beloved Qurux. It shines, and it warms me in this cold. I pray one day someone will avenge her, for I cannot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== AI Description ==
'''New Quest. The Creeping Apocalypse'''

This is a world quest! All crawlers ''and'' all hunters currently active on the sixth floor will receive this quest!

You may not opt out of this quest.

[[Miriam Dom]] the vampire has fallen. With the rising of today's sun, she found herself caught out in the open. Helpless and crying, she burned away into dust. The callous crawlers [[Carl]] and [[Donut|Princess Donut]] watched and did nothing as she died in agonizing pain. Nothing!

(Actually, not nothing. Someone should probably ask Carl why he suddenly has three new points to his intelligence stat. Suspicious!)

Anyway, Miriam did not go quietly into the good night. Oh no. Her death has cured thousands of crawlers monsters, and hunters who have been touched by the vampirism curse.

There is, however, a problem.

Some of the forest monsters infected with vampirism have spent the past few nights on a killing spree. And another vampire, a now-cured Allosaurus by the name of [[Big Tina]], unfortunately has expended a lot of effort on building an army of undead monstrosities using the... leftovers... from the forest-wide slaughter.

These newly created monsters are not vampires, and they were not cured when Miriam died. These mindless freaks were left all alone, not under control from any entity. Some are nothing more than mini-Grinder, also known as Shrillings, also known as Shambling Berserkers. We've all seen these before, most notably in some of the train stations at the end of the fourth floor. Yes, they can get pretty big and annoying, but it's not anything you really need to worry about. Hardly worth a regular quest, let alone a world one. You'd have to be a total idiot to let one of those things kill you, especially during the day. I'm looking at you, [[Nihit Kumar]] who's about two seconds from getting... Oh that's a shame, Gross.

Anyway, some of the other, more powerful monsters have become something else, and short of a god, they are the most powerful monsters who have ever set foot on a sixth floor in ''Dungeon Crawler World'' history.

I like to call them Odious Creepers.

The good news? Like Shambling Berserkers, Odious Creepers tend to be pretty slow during the day. The bad news? When it's dark outside, they gain the ability top combine with both Shamblers and other Creepers and get even stronger. And they can get fast, very fast. They can replicate themselves, too, if they have the parts!

There are currently fifty of these things... growing around... the forest, plus another few thousand Shambling Berserkers of various sizes. For fun, we have randomized their location. And for extra fun, we have marked the location of each creeper on the map for you all.

So here's the quest part. Kill all the Odious Creepers before the sun sets tonight.

For every Creeper you kill, you will receive +5 to a random stat. For every five you kill, you will receive an additional +5 levels. The crawler or hunter who kills the most will get an additional prize.

Only the person who does the most damage gets credit for the kill.

If you don't kill all of them before the sun sets tonight, bad stuff will happen. And I mean every single one of the fifty Creepers. And by bad stuff, I mean something completely batshit. And not just to the crawlers, but the hunters, too. So all of you cowards sitting on your ass in Zockau need to get to work.


'''Quest Failed. The Creeping Apocalypse'''

Holy shit. You idiots.

I warned you. I promised batshit consequences for failing one of the easiest world quests ever.

Here we go, bitches!

I can't help but notice the two remaining Odious Creepers happen to be where only the hunters could conceivably reach them. That's where this is going to start. You hunter guys holed up in Zockau are so fucked.

All of you may notice there's a new status bar in your interface. There's an official name for this thing, but I like to call it the blood bar. Effective immediately and for the remainder of this floor, all saferoom access - and this includes personal space access - is operated under tenth floor and below rules.

For those of you that don't know what that means, here's a quick lesson. You gotta earn your keep. This is an action-themed program, after all. Not some sappy drama where everyone just cries and masturbates all day long. I'm looking at you, Hunter Veeka.

All saferoom access is now timed for all hunters and crawlers. The moment you enter a safe area, your blood bar starts to count down. When it's full, you are given ten earth hours to be layabouts. If it reaches zero while you're still tucked away, you get randomly teleported to a location outside of the saferoom. If it's at zero, you cannot enter a saferoom at all, including guildhalls or locations that double as pubs.

You fill that blood bar by killing shit. It's simple, really. If you've been doing everything you're supposed to be doing, this particular change shouldn't bother you.

That's the change to the rules, but that's not the punishment y'all are receiving for failing the quest.

Gird your loins. This is a good one.

Starting with the location of the two remaining Odious Creepers, the spell ''Gehenna Bramble'' has been cast. This will spread outward at the average speed of four and a half kilometers per hour. Faster at night, slower in the sun.

If you're not familiar with the spell, here's a quick rundown. Every plant touched with the spell is transformed into a thick, impenetrable, ten-meter-high wall of thorn-covered vines that will undulate and thrust and attack. If you are pricked by the thorns, your blood immediately boils away, and you explode.

This spell cannot be countered. The plant cannot be poisoned and killed. The brambles can be beaten back, but they are relentless. They will not come within five square meters of a stairwell, but everything else will be encompassed, including towns and buildings and everything that's not a saferoom.

And it starts right now.

Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention regarding the saferoom rule. The filling of the blood bar is retroactive. That means if you haven't killed anything at all on this floor, your bar is empty. Heads up!

Good luck. And just remember, you brought this onto yourselves.

Devised by a [[Crocodilian]] crawler whilst she was falling down a deep pit that took over 10 minuets to reach the bottom.

Made from combining two potions, one used during the breeding of rock buffalo and another that mimics [[Katia Grim|Katia’s]] Crowd Blast ability. It only works while falling at speeds greater than 200 kilometers per hour.

When taken it causes anyone currently falling to speed up and softens any surface they hit causing them to bounce five times.

Denise is a feral goose.

== Trivia ==
It's revealed on the sixth floor that she loved reading to children.

== Abilities ==
Magic item’s don’t work in her presense and she can’t be harmed by magical or physical damage unless it's from items that originated from within the hosue.

== AI Description ==
Denise! The Feral Goose Mother! Level 53 Borough Boss!

Like most of the creatures in this godsforsaken bubble, Denise shouldn't be here. She was plucked directly from the seventh floor when her grandfather, emperor Anser, decided to use a magical gate to bring his people to this world. But like many of those who were unwilling in their journey to this place, she lingered too long in the inbetween. The [[Nothing]].

She paid dearly for it. Her mind is all but gone.

The gnomes captured her long ago, but they do not know what she really is. Denise doesn't know either. She has a few special abilities. Abilities that only recently started to manifest themselves. She can prevent magic from harming her. She is an environmental. She has an overwhelming need to protect children.

But most of all, she just wants to kill everybody. Especially bitches.

And guess what you are?

==Description==
You have found a desecrated temple! That means all the temple's attendants have been murdered. The temple's treasury has been looted. The sacred wine has probably been all lapped up, too.

And this used to be a nice town. It hasn't been the same since you guys moved in.

If you are an adherent of this temple, you may no longer worship here. You've also probably just received a quest to hunt down and kill the heather who did this.

If you ''don't'' worship this god, just scram. Remember that time you walked in on mommy and daddy playing leapfrog? It's just like that. Back away. Don't touch anything. Never talk about it again.

You should also probably avoid the person who did this. Not only does society frown upon those who slaughter whole congregations, but there are real consequences for this sort of stuff.

'''''Reward''''': You entered a building. You don't get a reward for that. It's not like you kicked it up a notch by defiling the shrine.

Oh, wait.

== Description ==
You have seen a deity. Don’t get too excited. It doesn’t mean you’re a prophet or anything like that. This is a pretty common achievement that all crawlers eventually receive if they survive long enough, so you aren’t really that special. Finding a god is easy. What you don’t want is for that god to find you.

''Reward'': You now have the option to worship the god [[Grull]].

Known for doing strange things such as impregnating herself then eating her own offsprings and forming cities with her poop.

During the [[Sixth Floor|Hunting Grounds]] she was sponsored by [[Circe Took]] so she could sleep with her daughter and cure her [[Arrow of Enthusiastic Double Gonorrhea|enthusiastic double gonorrhea]].

== Appearance ==
Her natural form is a giant squirrel like creature with antlers that's covered in moss and leaves.

The '''Doggy Door''' is a Tier-3 Personal Space Upgrade that allows crawlers to fast-travel to any door they have previously used on the floor, or to the location of other party members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI Description==
Personal Space Upgrade. Tier 3 Doggie Door. 

So, you’re out adventuring, and you suddenly have a hankerin’ for those sweet pancakes you had two weeks back at some dive that’s now over two hundred kilometers away. What are you gonna do? Travel for several hours in the wrong direction just to get another taste? Psshh. Okay, loser. 

The cool kids use the doggie door. 

Upgrades the door in your personal space to allow a selectable exit via any door you have previously utilized on this same floor, effectively creating a fast travel waypoint system. Allows shared gated access amongst guests and party members.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (pp. 596-597). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
As a Tier-3 Upgrade, the Doggy Door would not typically be available until the [[Ninth Floor]].  It costs 25million gold to install as a [[Guilds | Guild-wide]] upgrade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Story==
{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = [[Lucia Mar]] gives (5) of these to [[Li Jun]] and [[Li Na]] on the [[Eighth Floor]].  They installed one in [[Imani C]]'s personal space, so anyone who has access to Imani's room (i.e. all of [[Safehome Yolanda]] can quickly travel to the location of Meadowlark party members.

'''GC, BWR, NW Princess Donut the Queen Anne Chonk''' is the secondary protagonist of [[Dungeon Crawler Carl (Book) | Dungeon Crawler Carl]]. She is a tortoiseshell Persian cat formerly belonging to [[Carl|Carl's]] ex-girlfriend [[Beatrice]].  She is the party leader of the [[Royal Court of Princess Donut]]. 
== Description ==
Before entering the [[Dungeon]], Princess Donut was a pedigreed, award-winning show cat who belonged to [[Carl]]'s ex-girlfriend [[Beatrice]] and was bred by Bea's family.  She participated in shows "almost every weekend," and a full bedroom of their two-bedroom Seattle, WA apartment was dedicated to her ribbons, trophies, and awards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At home, Donut enjoyed yogurt and Purrfect Cat Treats, and spent her free time watching television or sitting in Carl's lap while he played video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the most upsetting moment of her pre-dungeon life, [[Angel]], the neighbor's cocker spaniel, broke one of Donut's jingly ball toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The morning of the [[Transformation]], Donut escapes the apartment for the first time with the intention of finding [[Ferdinand]], and Carl braves the freezing winter night to rescue her.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carl carries her down the [[Dungeon Entrance|staircase]],  and Donut receives a Legendary [[Quadruped Box]] for being the first cat to enter the Dungeon.  As the first crawler to enter the Dungeon with a cat, Carl receives a [[Pet Box|Legendary Pet Box]] containing an [[Enhanced Pet Biscuit]], which Donut snaps out of his hand before melting into a furry heap of goo.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she emerges as a talking, sentient cat with the [[Enhanced Growth]] buff, which elevates her base stats and gives her four (automatically assigned) stat points each time she levels up.  Now the party member with the highest total stat points, she is designated party leader and promptly renames the party the [[Royal Court of Princess Donut]] and changes Carl's title to "Royal Bodyguard."   She opens her Quadruped Box and does not read the description before equipping its prize, the [[Enchanted Crown of the Sepsis Whore]],  which requires her to slay the entire [[Blood Sultanate]] royal family on the [[Ninth Floor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Donut's low constitution prevents her from engaging in melee combat; instead, she largely relies on charisma and spells.   Near the end of the [[Second Floor]], she insists on adopting and bonding with [[Mongo]], who she treats like her child.     

After arriving on the [[Third Floor]], she selects the [[Cat]] race and the bard/rogue class [[Former Child Actor]], allowing her to pick a new class on each level.   As her repertoire of skills and spells continue to grow, she is rapidly becoming a jack-of-all-trades in the dungeon and a social media force in the galaxy.   

==Appearance==
A tortoiseshell Persian, Donut is described "one of those fluffy, flat-faced cats that look like they need to be sitting on the lap of a Bond villain" and as "fuzzy, black and beige and white."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Donut is deliberately depicted incorrectly on the book covers and in the Donut Holes logo.  Matt Dinniman commented on reddit, "Before I wrote books, I drew pictures of cats for a living. Torties are my favorite cats, but they are—by far—the most difficult colorings to draw, and I wasn't going to subject another artist to that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/197jid2/comment/ki1f2or/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button reddit comment] by Matt Dinniman (as u/hepafilter)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Have you ever woken up from a long dream, one where you’re one thing, and now that you’re awake, it takes you a moment to realize that’s not who you really are?”''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 70; chapter 8). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Princess Donut is a cat.   She's vain, likes pretty things, and is initially afraid of getting dirty or injured.   As she adjusts to her new awareness, she is rude enough that Carl prepares to leave her behind.  She apologizes and they work together (with some hiccups) to survive. While Donut has moments where she can charm NPCs to give the group what she wants, she can also be extremely abrasive in less than opportune moments.

Donut lives for the spotlight and pretends to be less clever than she is, but she is also extremely possessive and protective of "her" people.  She shows affection with head-bumps, purrs, and enthusiastic messages in all caps.  She has a deep fear of being left behind or abandoned.

==Relationships==
Her grandmother is Princess Chonkalot.

{{Character_info|species=[[Bune]]|status=Deceased, died on 11th or 12th floor of his crawl, sabotaged by the Naga}}

== Description ==
One of the authors of the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]], he was a crawler in a [[Naga]]-controlled season. He had a magic-based trap class, and had an elaborate scheme that was sabotaged by the show resulting in his death.  It was the last season that the Naga ran the show, and Drakea was partially responsible for bankrupting them. He has the most entries in the cookbook, with many of them rambling and filled with hatred for the Naga. He wrote little about himself.

He died on either the 11th or 12th floor when one of his traps exploded after being sabotaged by the naga, after his death the syndicate sued [[The Blood Sultanate]] and they filed for bankruptcy shortly afterwards.

== Cookbook Entries ==
The saferoom restrooms are a good place to read. Just don't take too long or you'll get pinched. The rats say there's a Syndicate rule that they can't watch you in the bathroom stalls. This is just for the actual toilets, not the rest of the bathrooms. Dunno if it's true. Those Naga bastards are a suspicious lot, and I fear I may soon be discovered. (Chapter 8, Book 3)

Once lit, a fire is easier to stoke than extinguish. Remember that. Fuck the snakes. Fuck the rats. Fuck them all. One day they will all burn, and while I'm certain I will be long dead, I will laugh. I will laugh long and hard, and I will be waiting for them on the other side of the veil where not even the vast expanse of stars or time will withhold my wrath. If you are reading this, friend, I pray you will join me. Side by side we will exact our revenge. (Chapter 13, Book 3)

We found one of them and tied him to the front of our shield. Ha. The next day the Nagas patched it. Didn't make an announcement or anything, but the guy disappeared. Went back to the church to grab him again, and wouldn't let us take him from the building. We dragged him out the door, and he exploded and was reborn, Tried it five times before giving up. Turns out he knew the password to the safe that held the key for the stairwell chamber. (Chapter 26, Book 3)

The hunters avoid the elites. They are smart enough to know not to fight against something they won't be allowed to easily defeat. The problem for us is elites are more dangerous than the hunters, and much more numerous. They should always be avoided. However, it appears some of the more powerful hunters go out of their way to hunt these elites anyway, all in a quest to gain more equipment and clout for themselves. It is a most dangerous game, one I am happy to watch play out. I am not yet powerful enough to kill either elite or hunter claw-to-claw, but with my new subclass, I am experimenting with hidden traps that may even the odds. I shall attempt not to directly slay either, but to bring hunter and elite together. The woman from the talk show let slip that the naga fools have offered insurance to those idiotic dramas that control the elite beasts. It will be my pleasure to watch the elites fail and die. While killing a hunter directly is a worthy feat, it is not a smart one. Killing individuals may be satisfying, but the true satisfaction is hurting them on a larger scale. When one values coin above life, you should target the coin, for it hurts them more. And that is my food. My life. My god. Hurting the naga and everyone responsible for this nightmare.  (Chapter 24, Book 5)

This is [[Volteeg]]'s first, last, and only entry in the cookbook. Fuck everything about this place. (Chapter 47, Book 5)

This was [[Ikicha]]'s last entry. It took me awhile to understand what our brother truly meant when he posted this. Now that I know, I, too, struggle with the knowledge. Gone is gone. Dead is dead, and anything presented to you in any other matter is nothing but a cruel, sadistic tease. We are on a fabricated stage surrounded by puppets built by the enemy. Do not ever forget this. Even if I succeed. Even if I survive to this fabled 18th floor and emerge victorious, I hold no cursed faith for those who have been lost, and I suggest you do not, either. But that doesn't mean we still can't have hope. I dream of a fire that spreads across the sky like the Winter Nebula. A fire that reaches the beginning and the end, and even though this fire exists only in my mind - for now - the warmth of it is enough to sustain me, even on the coldest of nights. For you, Ikicha.  (Chapter 52, Book 5)

This was [[Everly]]'s last entry. She did not mention the manner in which she was set up, which is unfortunate. Please, future author. Be as detailed as you can.  (Chapter 64, Book 5)

Ever since I hit the tenth floor, I've noticed a peculiarity in some of the mobs. It is difficult to put into words, but it is like they are embracing death more and more. It's not that they are willing to fall upon my traps, but there is a strange... Joy? Curiosity? that only appears at the very end, when they know they have been beaten. But there's more. There's frustration, too. I must admit, it scares me. I know this will sound unhinged, and maybe I am indeed the one who has lost their mind, but I can't stop thinking about it. The voice that runs this world has been getting stranger and stranger in its words and rulings. I believe it is moving into the minds of these monsters, taking them over, but just at the point of death. It's as if it's desperately attempting to know what it's like to lose it all. But it keeps failing, so it keeps trying. It's frustration grows. If only I could convince it to move into the minds of one of these nagas. (Chapter 42, Book 6)

If you get the chance, don't hesitate. Not for one second. (Chapter 50, Book 6)

This is [[Priestly]]'s second-to-last entry. Do yourself a favor. Don't read the last one. He doesn't make it to the battle once he sees what has happened to Larracos, and that's all you really need to know. Fuck them all. (Chapter 54, Book 6)

Remote Detonator Benefit

Level 15 Tripper Spell|source=Lusca(City Boss) - Gold Boss Box}}

== Description ==
This handy-dandy, versatile garment can be worn around the neck, in the hair, or on your face if you want to cosplay as a cowboy robbing a bank. Can also be tied around your arms or legs, but only if you want to look like a moron. Don’t tie it around your leg.

This simple, square piece of fabric is a reminder that looks can be deceiving.

== Effects ==
The wearer of this item receives the following benefits:

* +5 to the [[Detect Trap Skill|Detect Traps skill]].

* Wearer may cast a level-15 [[Tripper|''Tripper'' spell]] once every five hours.

*'''The Remote Detonator benefit:''' If you’re one of those explodey guys, I bet you use a lot of Hobgoblin Pus or Troll Boom-Boom Paste to make your bombs pop. Those days are now over. This benefit allows you to magically remote-detonate any explosive that has been designated by you. ''This benefit offers multiple physical and interface-based triggering options when combined with a Sapper’s table.''

== Trivia ==
Appears to be named for [[Drakea]]

A knee-high, fat, wrinkly monster with sharp claws and teeth. They stand on two feet but can climb on all fours. They wear loincloths and cry like babies.

'''Drek. Level 6.'''

Everybody loves babies, right? What kind of asshole doesn't love babies? How about demonic, ravenous, berserking babies who travel in packs of at least 50? It's rumored these lil' rascals can devour a full-sized elephant down to the bone in less than five seconds. And you're a lot smaller than an elephant.

== Description ==
The Dromedarians are a common, formerly nomadic race that is found throughout the drier parts of the universe. With the ability to store mass amounts of liquid in their bodies, it is said a Dromedarian can survive up to two months without taking a single sip of water. When these hunters and warriors are placed in a situation where they can no longer wander, they tend to become lethargic, sloth-minded creatures. But make no mistake, this is a mighty race of warriors who were once known for their abject brutality. 

Trapped atop the [[Fifth Floor|Necropolis of Anser]], these local Dromedarians are locked in a three-way stalemate with the Bactrians and the Dirigible Gnomes. Any day now this smoldering conflict could boil over into an all-out war. A war they probably would not survive. In the meantime, they’re perfectly content to sit around, smoke weed, and do their best to drink all their problems away.

== AI Description ==
'''New Quest. The Dumber of the Flunkies'''

THIS IS A GROUP QUEST. All survivors of the [[Where the Red God Glows|previous group ques]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t are now a party to this quest. And why the hell not, all Crawlers in Bubble number 18  are also added to the quest. Let's make it a fiesta.

''Your party has been designated Host of this Group Quest.''

No parties may opt-out of this quest.

Oh boy, oh boy do we have a situation here. [[Emberus]], god of fire and ash seems to believe that his son's missing puppy is inside of bubble 18. The dog is not, in fact, within that bubble. He's just outside of 543, having been recently rescued from a painful death. The next step should be easy. You just gotta bring the two together. Once that happens, both Emberus and [[Orthrus]] will immediately return to the Celestial Halls and everything will be almost back to normal.

If something happens to the pup, you will fail this quest. If you fail this quest, you will each in turn be smote by Emberus one by one, no matter what floor you're on. You probably don't know what that means. You don't want to know what that means.

Hmmm. Maybe that's a little too easy. Do you know not a single crawler in Bubble 18 has yet died? The whole world has been turned to lava, and they're all still alive! That's just ridiculous. That's no fiesta. Let me think on this for a minute.

'''''Reward''''': You will receive a [[Quest Box|Platinum Quest Box]].

The World Dungeon is an eighteen level maze created when Earth underwent the [[Transformation]].  It features on the current season of [[Dungeon Crawler World|''Dungeon Crawler World'']], which is produced by [[Borant|the Borant Corporation]].

==Description==
While the 18-Level World Dungeon is ostensibly a process by which a human can reclaim control of Earth from [[Borant]], it is really a way to generate income via advertising, sponsorships, royalties, and purchases in [[Dungeon Crawler World|''Dungeon Crawler World'']], a deadly alien game show.  Should a crawler actually exit the dungeon's [[Eighteenth Floor|18th]] floor, they will win regency of Earth. No crawler is expected to survive this long. One person in the history of Dungeon Crawler World made it as far as the [[Thirteenth Floor|13th]] floor. He died within 30 minutes.

==Floors==
Each floor is progressively more difficult.  [[First Floor|Floors 1]] and [[Second Floor|2]] are considered "[[Tutorial|tutorial]] levels."  After arriving on the [[Third Floor|third floor]], Crawlers are given the opportunity to choose their race and class.  They may further specialize their classes on the [[Sixth Floor|sixth floor]].   On the [[Fourth Floor|fourth floor]], sponsorship bidding begins and a [[Dungeon Leaderboard]] populates with the top ten crawlers. 

Floors [[Third Floor|3]], [[Sixth Floor|6]], [[Ninth Floor|9]], [[Twelfth Floor|12]], [[Fifteenth Floor|15]], and [[Eighteenth Floor|18]] are special in that they are all created at the same time and linked in an in-universe fairy tale. Excluding [[Third Floor|floor 3]], they are also the levels where "tourists," or rich [[Syndicate]] citizens, can pay to enter the floors and fight each other and/or crawlers. 

All other floors are created as needed, following a proposal submitted before the season airs. 

Each floor collapses after the specified time limit, killing any crawler who has not descended to the next floor or made a deal (typically for indentured servitude) to eventually exit the dungeon. In general, crawlers who enter the stairs to the next floor more than six hours before floor collapse are put in stasis until floor collapse and then placed on the next floor without being aware time has passed. Crawlers who descend with less than six hours remaining not only get more time leveling up, but are also allowed to move to the next floor immediately, getting a head start on those who descended early.

Here is a list of the floors in the dungeon with basic stats on the floor. All times are calculated from the known time of the [[Transformation]]. Each time assumes that the collapse timer for the next floor begins when the previous floor has six hours remaining.

Note: Though the year is never specified in the books, it does state that The Transformation occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd. 2017 was the most recent year prior to the book's publication that had January 3rd fall on a Tuesday. 2023 is the next time this will happen.  Just a fun fact for you.

==System AI==
The [[System AI]] maintains the operation of the World Dungeon, running everything from the physics systems to the item descriptions, awarding achievements and [[Loot Boxes|loot boxes]] to the crawlers, and generally acting as the main force keeping the dungeon deadly for the crawlers and interesting for the spectators watching the show.

== Inhabitants==
Aside from the crawlers making their way through the dungeon, each floor of the World Dungeon is filled with a variety of mobs and bosses placed there by the show runners to fight crawlers. In addition, NPCs provide services in the dungeon and act as [[quest]] givers and characters for the crawlers to interact with.

===New Crawlers===
Upon entering the Dungeon, new Crawlers are healed of any existing physical ailment or illness that may kill them; however, the denizens of Meadowlark are not healed of senility.  In Book 6, we learn that crawlers who previously took psychiatric medication may no longer require the medication.

Biologically female Crawlers are notified that their menstrual cycles have been suspended and they cannot fall pregnant while they are in the Dungeon.

Any children (with one obvious exception) or pregnant women who attempt to enter the Dungeon are teleported away to the kinder facility on Earth's surface.  Children that enter the dungeon aren't allowed to participate, if they enter the dungeon they are taken away and looked after by a [[Youth Assistant]], the minimum age depends on species and intelligence.

== History==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The original council nations accidentally tripped the Primal engines, causing galactic overpopulation.  Eventually the Primal elements were collected and the council concluded the “new biological overgrowth” had to be “beat back”.  The Hive, at the forefront of decoding Primal tech, developed the first macro AIs.  They made a proposal to the syndicate government, which was sent to subcommittee.  The dungeon crawl apparently originated there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;-Butcher’s Masquerade, Chapter 33

It is available in paperback, digital, and audiobook formats.

== Official Summary ==
'''Welcome to the Gun Show!'''

The top ten list is populated. The sponsorship program is open. The difficulty is ramping up. The first three floors were nothing compared to what Carl and Donut now face.

The Iron Tangle. An impossibly-complicated subway system built out of the world's subterranean railway systems, all combined and then tied together into a knot. Up is down. Down is up. Close is far. The cars are filled with monsters, the railway stations are less than safe, and the exit is always just a few stops away.

But there is hope. For the first time, the crawlers are all working together. The loot is better than ever. And the secret to unraveling it all may be hidden in the pages of a seemingly-useless book. Welcome, crawlers. Welcome to the fourth floor of the dungeon.

==AI Description (Public)==
'''Book.  ''The Dungeon Anarchist’s Cookbook'' by Anonymous.''' 

'''This is a unique item.''' 

'''Chicken and Goblin recipes galore! But it’s more than that, too. Each recipe is accompanied by a hilarious tale by the anonymous author, recounting some of the zany and madcap misadventures they experienced gathering these mouth-watering recipes. Fun for the whole family! This book is a real hoot.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (p. 121; chapter 7). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The cookbook is a thick book, approximately the size of a large dictionary, with a nondescript cover bearing an anarchy symbol in lieu of a title.  One of two single books presented to Carl as options on [[The Prize Carousel]] on the [[Fourth Floor|fourth floor]], the cookbook glints as the carousel turns; he "couldn’t tell if that was the glow of magic or the glint of light off the gold-leafed pages."&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (p. 119; chapter 7). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  

After selecting the item, Carl receives the same public AI description that everyone else sees.  It is not until he cracks open the book that his [[Escape Plan Skill|Escape Plan]] skill triggers, and he sees the true welcome message:

{{Quote
| quote = &lt;p&gt;Hello, Crawler. As you’re about to find, this is a very special book. If you’re reading these words, it means this book has found its way into your hands for one purpose and one purpose only. 
&lt;p&gt;Together, we will burn it all to the ground.
}}

Created by the System AI during the 15th season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', the cookbook has passed to crawlers who meet specific criteria and conditions.  When a crawler inherits the cookbook, a second page is added to their [[HUD / Crawler Menu|scratchpads]] that allows them to record their discoveries, experiences, recipes, secret societies, thoughts, and more, for future cookbook holders to use.

The cookbook takes a new form each time it enters the dungeon, typically tailored for the crawler. Neither the audience nor the show producers can see its contents, but the System AI is aware of its existence.  The book does not break dungeon rules but, should ''anyone at all'' suspect that it is more than it appears to be, the crawler will lose access to the book. The book disappears from the crawler's inventory upon death or retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette''''' is the largest, most-tunneled private program in Syndicate space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Odette]], dressed in a replica of her own Dungeon armor, is the star host of this widely viewed commentary program about ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]''.  She interviews popular crawlers and rehashes Dungeon events and related news in front of a large holographic audience.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The show tunnels immediately after ''Dungeon Crawler World''.  Although interviews are pre-taped, they typically take place only a few hours before the show airs.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

''After Hours'' is financed and produced by the [[Titan Conglomerate]], with assistance from "over a dozen participating, independent systems."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  One of the producers was marred by one of [[Lucia Mar]]'s dogs after the [[First Floor]] closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Setting ==
During the early stages of the Crawl, the show takes place on a black stage; the nebular background features spinning clouds of blue and red space dust, and bright dots of distant stars. Odette's desk is positioned next to a blue crushed velvet couch.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Odette arrives in Earth's orbit, the set and furniture change to appear as though Odette is on-stage in a large, baroque-style auditorium in [[Larracos]].  The virtual walls are plastered with water-stained, peeling advertisements for plays and musicals.  One such poster is for a play called "Session of Love," and features a camel clutching a [[Saccathian]] in a yellow wig.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dungeon Crawler Carl''''' is a fictional LitRPG adventure novel by Matt Dinniman, and is the first installment in the ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' [[:Category:DCC Books|book series]].  It is available in paperback, digital, and audiobook formats.  A limited edition hardcover reprint was recently funded on [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dinniman/dungeon-crawler-carl-v1-hardcover-editions Kickstarter].

==Abbreviated Summary==
After the [[The Transformation | transformation]], protagonists [[Carl]] and [[Donut | Princess Donut]] enter the [[Dungeon | World Dungeon]].  Part of a galaxy-wide gameshow called ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]],'' the fantasy RPG-themed Dungeon is controlled by a [[System AI]] and managed by the predominantly [[Kua-Tin|kua-tin]] [[Borant Corporation]].  As Carl and Donut explore the Dungeon's [[First Floor|first]] and [[Second Floor|second]] floors, they: meet their [[Game Guide|game guide]], [[Mordecai]], and new PR agent, [[Zev]]; team up with a group from an elderly care center called [[Meadow Lark]]; square off against two player killers, [[Frank Q]] and [[Maggie My]]; and guest star on ''[[Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette]]'' and ''[[Death Watch Extreme Dungeon Mayhem]].''

==Official Summary==
'''The apocalypse ''will'' be televised!'''

A man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.

In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth—from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds—collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.

The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.

Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.

'''You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.'''

You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that "it" factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That's the only way to truly survive in this game—with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.

They call it Dungeon Crawler World. But for Carl, it's anything but a game.

'''''Dungeon Crawler World''''' is the galactic tunnel sensation about survival!  New seasons of the show debut every 2.25 Earth Years to an audience of quintillions of Syndicate citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current season is [[Dungeon Crawler World: Earth|''Dungeon Crawler World: Earth'']].

__TOC__
== Description==
The program ''Dungeon Crawler World'' is owned by the [[Syndicate]] government, but each season is produced by a different corporation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each corporation puts their own spin on the production, but must choose a type of "Dungeon" outlined in the [[Indigenous Species Protection Act|Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act]]&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Dungeon, whatever form it takes, is overseen by a [[System AI]].

Regardless of production company, the show's premise is always the same: thousands of years after a planet is seeded (typically with one of six basic starter species, such as [[Human | Humans]] or [[Skyfowl]]), the producing company mines the planet for rare resources via a planetwide collection (i.e. the [[Transformation]]).  Survivors are then given their legal right to "reclaim" their planet's resources by conquering a Dungeon, which is broadcast to the universe as ''Dungeon Crawler World.''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Dungeon Variations===
#Battle Royale
#[[Dungeon | 18-Level World Dungeon]]

===How to Watch ===
While the crawl has always been popular, it used to be aired on delay (of an hour or a year) to everyone outside of the [[Center System]].  A few hundred seasons ago, [[the Plenty]] introduced the modern tunneling system, making it possible for everyone in the Syndicate to view the crawl (and follow their favorite crawlers) in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Beginning on the [[Second Floor]] of the 18-Level Dungeon, all crawlers can be viewed by anyone at almost any time.

===Revenue===
The host company receives income from the mining operation as well as advertising income, a stipend from the Syndicate government, and commission on every credit spent by patrons, viewers, and tourists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Private production companies may pay an advertising stipend to produce their own shows about the crawl, such as ''[[Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette]],'' as well as additional fees to pull specific crawlers from the dungeon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

The host company does not receive '''&lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt;''' revenue generated by the show until after the season is over, but is required to pay taxes to the Syndicate on every non-sponsored loot box distributed to crawlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|2|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules &amp; Restrictions ==
#Several hundred cycles ago, the Syndicate changed how NPC pools work.  Previously, anyone who took a contract to feature as an NPC on the program could appear on any season, regardless of which company was managing the Dungeon.  Following the revision, NPCs can only serve in Dungeons managed by the company that they signed a contract with.  This has had the unfortunate result of extending many indentureship contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#250 [[ cycles]] ago, the Syndicate introduced a rule forbidding surveillance in bathrooms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{ref|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Relatively recently, following the particularly brutal incident with Crawler [[Hoon]] in a [[Valtay]] Dungeon, the Syndicate has banned using collected children and pregnant women in the game.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ref|4|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
== Production Companies &amp; Trends==
The most recent seasons have been hosted by:
#Fortent
#Squim Conglomerate - ''Dungeon Crawler World: Aryl''
#Borant - ''Dungeon Crawler World: Earth''
#Valtay - Next Season, TBD

==='''The [[Borant Corporation]]'''===
The Borant Corporation favors a fantasy-themed 18 Level World Dungeon, and is known for "making the most elaborate, most entertaining dungeons."   Borant is typically selected to host one of every fifteen seasons (with at least seven cycles between Borant-hosted seasons), including ''Dungeon Crawler World: Earth''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borant invests a great deal of time and resources into preparing each dungeon and tailoring it to suit the world it takes place on.  At any given time, five forward teams are deployed to candidate planets, where they study the locals and - when needed - directly influence pop culture to ensure that the inhabitants will understand the game and its notifications when the time comes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{ref|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first prep team arrived on Earth in 1937.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Previous Borant-hosted seasons have featured six or seven other human-seeded worlds and at least two [[skyfowl]]-seeded worlds.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  They typically aim to have ten million crawlers enter the Dungeon, but a complete wipe-out in the [[Ninth Floor]] Faction Wars is not uncommon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

The last dungeon that Borant managed was a mess;  not only were there no rest areas (which is why toilet paper is complimentary and restrooms are everywhere in the current dungeon), but also the slot-based inventory system had weight restrictions, limited capacity, and allowed food to expire, so thousands of crawlers starved to death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entire fourth floor took place inside of a living creature that developed a bacterial infection, causing the walls to cave in and sections to fill with gore as crawlers navigated its intestines and organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='''The Blood Sultanate of the Naga'''===
Over 250 cycles ago, the Blood Sultanate ran the first Crawl to lose money.  They have not financially recovered and have not run a single crawl since.  Part of the extreme expense was that the Blood Sultanate distributed a record-breaking (18) Celestial [[Loot Boxes]] over the course of the season, and part was likely due to lawsuits against the Blood Sultanate's "acceleration" of celebrated crawler [[Drakea]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==='''[[Fortent]]'''===
Fortent hosted the show two seasons before Earth.  Three dungeon admins died to a single crocodilian crawler when Fortent decided to use their own security force to subdue the crawler, rather than relying on the System AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='''[[The Squim Conglomerate]]'''===
The Squim Conglomerate prefers battle royale-style fights with a single champion, which is a less profitable format than the World Dungeon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After mining the planet and completing the show, the Squim Conglomerate leaves any survivors behind without resources or atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{ref|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Squim Conglomerate hosted the last season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'' approximately 2.25 Earth years ago on the planet Aryl, which was seeded with a gorilla-like species.  The battle royale took place in a massive multilevel colosseum.  Combatants were broken into groups and told their loved ones would be safe only if they killed each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==='''[[Valtay|The Valtay Corporation]]'''===
Slated to run the next season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', the Valtay Corporation's version of the 18-Level World Dungeon is sci-fi themed with "android death machines and pulse rifles."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Drick]] survived a Valtay season on an [[Iguanoid]]-seeded world some 400 seasons ago, but Valtay Dungeons are known for being particularly brutal:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Who could forget that Valtay season when Crawler Hoon piloted his mech to the elevator leading to the 12th floor, only to find his own children—repurposed as sentinel hunter killers—guarding the exit? All five of them, even the yearling.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The Crawl started when the original [[Syndicate Council]] nations accidentally tripped the [[Primal engine]], kicking off a chain reaction that lead to overpopulation across the galaxy.  The Council eventually resolved to collect primal elements from and cull the growing populations of pre-seeded worlds, but bumped into red tape.  The [[Dark Hive]] then requested the ability to test [[Macro AI]]-controlled [[Enhancement Zones]], which lead to the creation of a Syndicate subcommittee that ultimately resulted in a complex tangle of laws and the creation of ''Dungeon Crawler World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

For the first few seasons of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', presumably as a tribute to its origins, all contestants started as the [[Primal]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more about the history of the crawl, check out ''A Petite Chronicle of the Crawl: One Lady's Journey into Enlightenment through Knowledge and Scholarship and Three-Beat Poetry'' by [[Sydnee Iglacia|Sydnee]], as endorsed by Crawler [[Carl]]!&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ref|5|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*Several seasons ago, a Dungeon had a level where every weapon found on the floor was possessed by a withering spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also many seasons ago, the entire seventh floor was themed around the [[Guild of Suffering]] attempting to raise their god.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote = “The entrance appeared right in the street, literally in the middle of the group. A bunch of folks fell in. There were stairs just like you said. But then Agatha over there pushed her cart right onto the stairs like she was… well I don’t know what the hell she was doing. But the stairs transformed into a ramp. It '''wanted''' her to come on down. A long, easy ramp. Agatha was the first to voluntarily go down there, cackling like she always does. Hollerin’ she’d saved all our lives." -- &lt;small&gt;[[Brandon An]] (Book 1, Chapter 22)&lt;/small&gt;

New Crawlers enter the Dungeon by descending a stairwell from the Earth's surface. 

==The Staircase== 
The brightly lit stairwell is made of wide wrought iron steps engraved with a strange "almost Asian-looking" pattern depicting demon-like fish, and seems to descend forever before terminating at a marble floor and a 30' W x 30' H (9.14 m) arched, wooden double door carved with the same stylized, oversized [[Kua-Tin|Kua-tin]]. The base of the stairwell is humid and balmy, approximately 80°F (27°C). Looking at the engraving on the door triggers a tool tip/infobox, suggesting that crawlers have limited access to the [[HUD / Crawler Menu|HUD]] before entering the Dungeon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stairwell Distribution===      
After [[The Transformation|the transformation]] and subsequent AI announcement, a trumpet-like horn sounds and 150,000 stairwells are randomly distributed in high population areas across Earth.  Each stairwell entrance is marked by a spotlight-like light.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although technically "random," stairwell locations are monitored by an AI and are rarely distributed equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stairwells are more likely to appear in areas where eligible crawlers are gathered. If a stairwell appears under where a person was standing, that person falls into the stairwell and disappears; it is unclear whether they land safely at the bottom or are "recycled."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Time Limits===
Potential crawlers have one hour to prepare and descend the stairwell before the stairwells disappear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Humans and animals are able to enter and exit the stairwell at least three times before it physically prevents them from leaving again.  Forty minutes after the stairwells open, a new announcement declares that anyone "lurking" in the stairwells must join the crawl.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Entering the Dungeon==
After opening the double doors and stepping into the Dungeon, any biological creature above a certain weight is assigned a crawler ID.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New crawlers receive the following message followed by any circumstantial achievements earned for entering the Dungeon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''You have been designated Crawler Number ___.  You have been assigned the Crawler Name “___.”'''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;'''You are assigned the race of Human. You are currently level 1. You may choose a new race and class as soon as you descend to the third floor. Your stat points have been assigned based on your current physical and mental profile. See the stat menu for more details.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 16). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biologically female crawlers receive a notification that their menstrual cycles have stopped and they cannot conceive until after the crawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pregnant women and children are relocated to the [[Kinder Facility]] on Earth's surface.

== AI Description ==
You have invented a stackable weapon, device, or potion. You will be memorialized for eternity with your name in the ''Dungeon Codex''. Just don’t let it go to your head, Elon.

'''Reward:''' For every kill made with this device by other crawlers, you will receive a single gold coin. If you survive the dungeon, you will continue to receive this benefit—even during future seasons—at the current gold to credit exchange rate for the remainder of your natural life. Our lawyers made us put that last part in, but between you and me, we both know you’re going to die, and we’re going to keep using your hard work for our own benefit.

== AI Description ==
''Per subsection 1256-C of the Indigenous Species Protection Act, this particular reward is required by the Syndicate Government to be awarded to all Crawlers who have chosen a domestic class.''

''Taking this potion is optional, however it may not be sold or transferred to other Crawlers or entities.''

Upon drinking this, you will immediately obtain a Level Three skill ability in a unique, Earth-based hobby. The benefit is chosen at random, however you will not receive a skill that you currently have.

Gods, I hate it when the lawyers make me put their crap into the descriptions. Don’t you? Anyway, this could be something useful like Parkour or Jui-jitsu, or you could get fucked and receive some useless crap like Stamp Collecting or Kombucha Brewing. Don’t get your hopes up. The fact your planet was filled with so many boring assholes with inane, ridiculous hobbies tips the scales way out of your favor.

==Introductory Announcement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;Hello, crawlers.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Welcome to the eighth floor. The Ghosts of Earth.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;This is going to be a long message. This floor is simple, but the environment requires a small amount of explanation. Not that you twits are going to understand either way.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;You have all picked one of 293 different regions. We have just over 38,000 crawlers joining us, and of the groups, you are occupying 205 of the regions. Unlike the bubbles of the fifth floor, you are not distributed evenly. But just because you don’t see anybody else, it doesn’t mean you’re alone. Each region contains two stairwells, and you have been generated near one of the two.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;The theme of this floor is broken up into two parts. Phase two starts in 14 Earth days. You will not be able to obtain an exit key until then. Thank the gods. For the next two weeks, you will be stuck within your starting area.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;All crawlers have been placed in squads of no more than five. If your party is six or more, the party members have been split into equal-number squads of less than five. These squads are not able to be broken. If you leave your party, you will not leave the squad. You have to work together to survive.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;You’ll notice your squad has six more spots than the number of crawlers. So if you’re by yourself, it’ll have seven spots total, and if your squad consists of five crawlers, it’ll have eleven spots total. Your job for the next fourteen days is to fill your squad. You will be required to fill your squad before you will be allowed to proceed to phase two. If you do not fill your squad before the timer runs out, it will be filled randomly. Trust me. You don’t want that. We’ll get to that in a moment.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;In fourteen days, you will be given at least two options on where to send your squad for the second phase. It will be a different geographic location than where you’ve started. You, along with your full squad, will be required to fight your way to an exit key. This will not be easy, so it is in your best interest to make certain your squad is as powerful as you can handle. More details on the assault phase of this floor will be forthcoming.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;This is how phase one works.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;All of you are inside a large structure within your starting area. As soon as this message ends, the doors will open, and you will be allowed to proceed outside.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Each region is limited, but you will have plenty of area to investigate. In most cases, you will be allowed to explore in a circle of about 99 kilometers from your starting location in any direction. If this causes an overlap with another region, this distance will be shortened. If you are on an island, you will not be able to venture more than six kilometers off shore.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;You will not be able to enter any other regions during phase one.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Your starting area is an exact replica of Earth’s surface area as captured on the indicated date. This includes all the geographic features, buildings, vehicles, and yes, the people.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;That’s correct. You will be fighting and exploring in a precise facsimile of Earth in the weeks before the collapse.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;There are a few important caveats. You’re living inside of a memory. In most cases, you will not be able to interact with mobile biological entities within the replay. They will not appear on your map. Think of them like intangible ghosts. They can’t see you, and if you touch them, you will go right through them. They will be going about their lives just as they did on the day of the recording.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;However, and this is very important so pay attention, all non-biological, non-attached items will be tangibly present and will maintain their mass and momentum until physically interacted with by a crawler or a mob or an unexpected environmental factor.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;You can enter buildings. You can use non-automatic doors in most cases. You can break windows. You can get hit and killed by a vehicle. You can go to a grocery store and take all the onions. You can allow a person to walk through you, which will likely rip the clothes from their bodies. The visible portions of their bodies will continue on their way. The people and animals are ghosts. Everything else is not. Complex machines may or may not work depending on what they are. You can pick an onion or piece of tofu out of a ghost’s hand and throw it at a mob. The ghost will continue to eat, but the onion will now be on the ground. You can place a barrier in a street, and a car will crash into it, but the ghostly avatars of the drivers will continue on their way, floating toward their destination as if the accident never happened.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;In other words, you can destroy the environment as much as you like. You can move mountains if you have the power. The physical items will only move as they did on that date if they are in the exact place and condition they were at the time of recording. The world is your literal playground.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Note. Anything you loot on this level that comes from the earth memory will turn to dust upon the collapse of this level. You will not be arming yourselves with the content of your local military base for use on the ninth floor.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;That’s the environment. Now let us get to the squads.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Your area is seeded with mobs and bosses and legendary creatures that are exclusive to the folklore of the region in which you inhabit. For example, those of you in Romania will be dealing with vampires and werewolves. Those of you in Ireland will have leprechauns and banshees. Those of you in Japan are just plain fucked.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;The further out from your starting area, the more difficult the monsters and bosses you will face. These monsters will also be interacting with the environment, so it’s likely their locations will be obvious, especially if the mobs are unintelligent as they will be attempting to attack the noncorporeal locals.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;At the end of this message, your squad leader will receive a set of twenty flags containing your squad’s logo, which has been automatically created by the system.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;If you plant the flag within the body of a living entity while they are at less than 5% health, they will be transformed into something called a T’Ghee totem, which will be added to the squad leader’s inventory.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;If it is a noncorporeal monster, the flags will still work. Flagged monsters will automatically join your squad and will automatically be minions of whomever summons them. They will follow the summoner’s orders.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;That is, they will follow orders to a certain extent, depending on the level difference and nature of the monster. While you need a squad that’s as powerful as possible, it might not be in your best interests to build a team that’s a little too strong. You may dismiss mob squad members if they don’t work out by ripping the T’Ghee totem in two.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;If you run out of or lose your twenty flags before your squad is filled, they will not be replaced, so be careful with them. You may collect more totems than squad spaces. You may trade totems with fellow crawlers. You may steal totems from fellow crawlers.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Upon the start of phase two, all non-placed totems will dissipate. All surviving squads may choose a single T’ghee card to keep upon the collapse of this floor.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;That’s it for now. More details on phase two will become available in a few days. Furthermore, fighting with T’Ghee totems comes with a few additional rules, which will be explained after the next recap episode. I’m supposed to explain that part now, but honestly, you monkeys think you’re so smart and clever, and I’m certain you can figure it out on your own.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Now get out there and kill, kill, you know.&lt;/small&gt;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Goddess of Childbirth and Female Pain Eileithyia. Level 250.''' 

'''Sponsored by [[Huanxin Jinx]] of the [[Grixist Swarm]], CEO of [[Icon Industries]]'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. She is invulnerable on this floor.'''

''This goddess has been temporarily summoned to this location. Summoning rules apply.''

Eileithyia is something of an oddity. She's benevolent. Unlike most of these psychos, she's known for her kind heart. She's prayed to by all mothers, both when they're attempting to sow the seeds, and when the harvest comes. And while she does many things, she's mostly known as She Who Eases Pain. Both the physical pain of childbirth and the inevitable darkness that comes to those who are unable to complete their most sacred task. When the stillness comes, she is not the one who has caused the heartbreak. But she is the one holding the grieving mother's hand.

She's not known to be someone who seeks the throne, which likely makes her one of the most qualified of the deities to claim the title.

Hopefully her sponsor this season is someone who shares the same grace as her character.

== Real world basis ==
Eileithyia was the Greek goddess of childbirth and midwifery. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileithyia&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes they're NPCs, sometimes they're mobs, but usually they're just assholes. Elites are powerful, one-of-a-kind entities. These are the non-boss, non-divine hero class of Dungeon Crawler World. If you come across one of these egomaniacs, they will either want to fuck you or kill you. Either way, they will always want to use you. They tend to think this while production is all about them. Be careful. Where there's one elite, there's usually more.

[[File:DCCBook04.jpg|thumb|Emberus as seen on the cover of book four.]]
'''Sun and Ash God Emberus. Level 250.'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. He is invulnerable on this floor.'''

'''This is a locked god. There will be no sponsors of this deity this season.'''

''This god has been summoned to this location. Summoning rules apply.''

The youngest brother of [[Taranis]], and half of the sun duology, Emberus strongly feels he is the best-suited candidate to ascend to the Celestial Throne. Known to be stoic and indifferent to the suffering of all but those he feels worthy, Emberus can be a just god if the fancy strikes him. The problem is the fancy hasn’t struck in a very long time. He’s usually an unmitigated asshole who’ll arbitrarily burn everyone you know and love just for looking at him funny. He’s considered one of the most unhinged of all the pantheon.

His twin brother is [[Hellik]], another sun god who is quite obsessed with killing both Emberus and big brother Taranis. It’s a very dysfunctional relationship. I guess most families are like this. You probably don’t want to get involved.

Emberus’s very presence can be deadly to crawlers, and that’s just when he’s in his regular form. When he gets emotional, things really start to heat up.

Word on the street is that since his favorite son was murdered by an unknown assailant, Emberus has been acting even kookier than usual. The dude plucked his own eyes out in his grief. It was really gross.

== Devotee Notification ==
Congratulations, Crawler. You have devoted your life and fate to one of service. You are now an adherent of Emberus, God of Sun and Ash!

Your ranking in the church: Acolyte.

''Warning: You do not have a cleric or paladin class. As such, you may not ascend past Devotee. See the Deity tab for more information.''

Emberus, the personification of a star’s destructive power, welcomes you into his warm embrace. He welcomes all who accept his core philosophy. Emberus believes power, once held, must never sit idle. It is to be used and never squandered.

Because of your new-found faith, you must adhere to the following rules, lest you provoke the god’s wrath.

* You mustn’t cause harm to fellow worshippers of Emberus.
* You must stop and offer a single drop of blood at an Emberus temple at least once a day. If no temples are found in a 30-hour period, you must make the offering at the sun shrine that has now appeared in your personal space.
* Five percent of all looted gold must also be tossed into the shrine.
* You may not own or wield any magical gear that is blessed by the god Hellik.
* You must successfully complete all issued church quests.

All adherents in good standing with the God Emberus receive the following holy benefits:

This new rank comes with the following benefits:

* Your tithe amount has moved from 5% to 10% effective immediately.

'''Enchanted Anarchist’s Battle Rattle. '''

This sleeveless jacket in its current form only offers meager protections compared to some other items of this caliber. However, its ability to host as many upgrade patches as you can fit makes this one of the best, most upgradeable protection items in the game. 

The plain, unadorned version of this jacket imbues the following effects:  

*+1 to all base stats.
*This base stat upgrade increases by +1 for every compatible patch that is added to this jacket. 
**If an eligible Back Patch is added, this benefit is doubled.

== AI Description ==
Imbues wearer with +1 Dexterity, +1 Constitution, and gives +3 to the skill [[Double Tap]]. It’s also an anklet. One would think anklets enhance the beauty of feet like toe rings do, but they are excessive, jangly distractions that make you look too garish&lt;ref&gt;''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 6)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Originally received in a Bronze Boss Box on the Second Floor received from killing the Krakaren Clone Level 10 Neighborhood Boss. They where upgraded by a [[Scroll of Upgrade]] on the Third Floor.

== AI Description ==
Have you ever read an Incredible Hulk comic and thought to yourself, everything rips off of his body except his pants? No way. Well, spoiler alert. You’re not wrong. Size-altering and were-creatures, such as the BigBoi are required to wear enchanted, self-sizing items lest they wish to turn the dungeon into a nudist colony when they transform. That means everything they wear requires an enchantment. Everything, including their naughty little undies.

* + 2 to Constitution
* Wearer may cast a level 15 [[Protective Shell]] once every 30 hours.

== Upgrade ==
This item has been Upgraded once.

All right, you already know the description of this item. Something something Incredible Hulk, blah, blah, blah. Now you want to know how this item has been upgraded. Right? So here are the original benefits of these naughty little undies:

* + 2 to Constitution
* Wearer may cast a level 15 Protective Shell once every 30 hours.

That’s some good shit right there. But we can do better than that. Here’s a few additional benefits.

* + 5 to Dexterity
* + 5 to Intelligence
* + 3 more (for a total of + 5) to Constitution
* + [[Freeballing Benefit|The Freeballing Benefit]]: Usually reserved for monk classes and those too soused to reliably dress themselves, recipients of this benefit receive an additional 100% damage bonus to all attacks that originate below the waist. In addition, all skills that originate from below the waist train 20% faster. But as the name implies, this benefit allows only a single layer of armor or clothing to cover your crotch area. And since you’re already wearing these, it looks like you won’t be getting trousers anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;

She lost it at the end of the third floor. [[Eva]] picked it up but it is currently in [[Katia Grim|Katia]]’s possession.

==Description==
Who’s a dirty girl? You’re a dirty girl!

This is a Fleeting item!

This is a Unique* item!

'''Warning!''' (Seriously though. I’m going to say this again. '''WARNING!''' Read this shit before you put it on.) Placing this crown upon your head permanently places you within the royal line of succession for the Blood Sultanate on the ninth floor of the world dungeon. Removing this item will not remove this status. Royal members of the Blood Sultanate will be required to slay the Sultan and all other members of the royal family before descending to the tenth floor. You’ll only want to wear this if you’re a blood-thirsty, raging psychopath.

==Effects==

*Imbues wearer with +5 Intelligence
*Grants the user +5 to the Good First Impression skill
*All attacks, including magical attacks, now have a 15% chance to inflict the Sepsis debuff.

Light and flexible, this scale armor is made from Fae Steel. While not as strong as Elven mail or even good Orcish steel, it’s the strongest alloy that fairy folk can wear. It’s not the best protection, but it’ll make your ass look oh so pretty.

This is a Fleeting Item

Fun Fact. There is not a single dentist from your world left in the dungeon. A few made it to the first floor, but every single one of those fuckers is now tits up. There's a few hygienists left, but I wouldn't want to rely on those chuckleheads. So what I'm getting at is that you need to install these yourself. Make sure they're facing the right direction. You can always take them off but this is a fleeting Item. That means they disappear once they're off. So don't fuck it up.

Turns two of your incisors into ripping, tearing, deadly choppers that would impress even the most self-hating goth.

* Increases melee bite damage by 50%
* Each bite attack has a 25% change to inflict level-five Poisoned status

Carl steals the farseer from Skarn, a juvenile Changling in Hump Town (Fifth Floor)

== Description ==
Used to sight long-range targets for their bomb runs, the FarSeerer is credited as one of the five key inventions that allowed the Dirigible Gnomes to obtain air superiority. When properly installed on a Gnomish Dreadnaught, this device increases the accuracy of gravity-based bombs by 75%. Allows for inspection and information on objects at a distance. It’s pretty good for spying on your neighbors, too. You don’t need porn when you got this thing hanging off the edge of your airship. 

'''Warning''': All gnomes targeted with this device are given a notice that they are being watched.

Oooh, that’s scary sounding.

If utilized properly, this ring’s wielder can grow exponentially in strength, especially on the deeper floors. But beware. If poorly wielded, this ring will kill you quicker than an exploding rage elemental. Either way, this ring imparts one of the dungeon’s most highly sought-after skills.

[[File:00537.jpg|thumb|[[Enchanted Nipple Ring of the Superior Fire Demon’s Hand Maiden]]]]

== AI Description ==
This may only be equipped on a quadruped.

This may only be equipped on a female.

All nipple rings must be manually affixed the first time they are equipped.

Oh boy. Let me tell you about Superior fire demons. These bitches are crazy. Worse than the minor demons. I know, I know. That sounds chauvinistic and rude. You can’t get away with saying shit like that anymore. Here’s the thing. These bitches ''are'' godsdamned crazy. Full stop. You look that shit up in Wikipedia, and it’ll be the first line. It’ll say “These bitches are three pugs short of a grumble.” It’s not an opinion, but an absolute fact.

We have a whole matriarchal hierarchy of demons who exist and fight and vie for control of the fifteenth level, and these Superior Demon nutjobs are always causing the most chaos, which is saying ''a lot''.

You got the lesser demons, who are generally normal, though I wouldn’t break up with one over text or call her fat or anything like that. Then you got the more powerful minor demons. Those bitches are something else, but they’re nothing compared to Superior fire demons. These ladies are so batshit, the demon lords and queens require all of them to be “chaperoned” by hellspawn familiars everywhere they go, whose job it is to protect them from each other and themselves. It’s Sheol’s version of a Xanax. Or maybe a restraining order.

These familiars need to be protected from the superior demons. This nipple ring is one of the items they utilize.

Wearing this nipple ring offers the following benefits:

* Allows the removal of cursed items.
* User is impervious to natural fire.
* User is impervious to lava attacks.
* User is resistant to fire-based spells.
* User will not lose health while inside Sheol.
* All spells with a fire attack now deal (Intelligence)% more damage.
* All demon worshippers are visible and marked on your map.
* User may cast [[Bitch, What?|''Bitch, What''?]] Once a day.

This item has been upgraded three times.

Warning: this item has a 50% chance to permanently break if it's upgraded again.

This murky bracelet is light and kinda stylish if you're one of those sad sacks who always wears black and complains about how nobody ever understands you. It's made of obsidian glass, which is a type of rock that only forms under extreme, lava-based circumstances. And interestingly enough, this is what you'll turn into if you don't treat this item with the respect it deserves.

This bracelet imbues the following effects.
*+10 to Constitution
*+5 to Dexterity
*+15% Fire Resistance
*Wearer may cast a level-10 Fireball spell once every twenty minutes.

This kit contains 12 essential items for proper foot care.

The magical enhancements of this item may only be imbued within a Safe or Personal Space.

Warning: All of these enhancements require you to remain barefoot.

Why? Because you know why.

From a pumice stone to a cuticle pusher, this personal hygiene kit will keep your feet both luscious and in perfect fighting shape. Nightly care of your feet and toenails will result in the following bonuses:

* +15% Damage to bare-foot attacks for 30 hours.
* +3 to the Smush skill for 30 hours.
* +Unbreakable buff (feet only) for 30 hours. This buff keeps your pretty little metatarsals nice and unbroken.
* +Celestially Nimble and Tidy buff (feet only) for 30 hours. Not only will your tootsies look nice, bright, and shiny, but any traps set off by footfalls will now prompt an alarm and have a 5-second delay before being triggered.

== AI Description ==
This is a unique item.

This is a repeating, ranged weapon. It has the buffet enchantment, meaning it will not run out of basic ammunition. You may load and fire additional ammunition types to use with this weapon, though any special bonuses will only apply to the stock ammunition.

It is said that the long-forgotten goddess [[Nekhebit]] is both jealous and terrible. When the elf mothers chose to abandon Nekhebit and instead worship [[Apito]], the Oak Goddess, it is written Nekhebit grew enraged. The mighty vulture goddess blamed the male-dominated high elf court for causing her worshippers to stray. As a result, she cursed their seed, thus creating what is today known as the Fae Diaspora. There are dozens of elf and fairy breeds, all of whom may trace their lineage back to the early high elf court, whose cursed offspring sowed the universe.

This crossbow is rumored to have been given to Nekhebit’s last warrior guardian as a gift for remaining true to her faith.

* This item may only be wielded by a female.
* For every female in your party, up to thirty, this item’s damage and firing speed is increased by 25 percent.
* Your strength+level increases base damage 1.5X more than a standard crossbow.
* +15 Dexterity when wielded
* +10 Strength when wielded
* Casts Birth Defect on monster types who generate or birth additional monsters.

== AI Description ==
You ever meet one of those dudes who is always super quick to take offense to everything? You gotta walk on eggshells around him. Has some job where he wears a shirt and tie even though he looks like he just woke up in an alley somewhere.

He’s always saying, “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” He hits on anything with a pulse. He wants people to call him T-Bone or Bulldog or something. He dies of a heart attack in his mid-forties.

You get my drift.

Well, this little auto buckler is the armor version of that. This auto-deploying, overly-enthusiastic, small-sized buckler has a chance to catch both physical and magic bolt attacks and toss them right back at the caster.

It’s not perfect, but who the hell are you to judge?

Equipping this small buckler imbues the following effects:

* Catch physical attacks (Success percentage based off user’s dexterity)
* Catch magical bolt attacks (Success percentage based off user’s intelligence.)
* All stopped attacks have a 75% chance to reflect back to attacker.
* All successfully reflected attacks have a 25% chance to double in power.

Attacks must be caught with the buckler in order to work.

A shield belonging to [[Katia Grim]]

== AI Description ==
Sometimes the galaxy isn’t a happy place. Sometimes the unwashed masses forget their place in the machine. And sometimes these dregs bubble up to the surface, causing a phenomenon widely known as “Civil Unrest.”

And when that happens, the powers that be don’t want to become the powers that were. So they hire backup. An outside force to come down and kick everything back into order, and maybe commit a few war crimes in the process just so the filth knows their place. One such outfit, trained specifically for this sort of situation, is the Shade Gnoll Riot Forces.

This enchanted shield offers both offensive and defensive crowd control options. A frontline defender utilizing this item is afforded the following benefits:

* +5% to Constitution.
* +5 to the [[Rooted in Place]] Skill
* +Upgrades [[Rush]] ability to [[Crowd Blast]].
* Warning: You may not equip this item. The Rush ability is required to equip this item.


'''Rooted in Place:''' This skill makes it much more difficult to knock you over or back. That’s not necessarily a good thing, physics being what they are. Be careful with this one.

“AnD SO The lioN fEll iN lOVe WiTh The LaMB.”

I’m actually quite fond of the ''Twilight'' novels. Plus, I would never stoop so low as to disparage the work of an over-imaginative and obviously undersexed artist who managed to become a brazilianaire from barely-disguised erotica targeted at adolescent girls. However, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that your culture’s obsession with fictional underaged heroes was absolutely misguided.

Paul Atreides was fifteen years old. Harry Potter was just eleven in the beginning of the first book. The kids from ''Stranger Things'' were all tweens. Kid ‘n Play were (portrayed to be) high schoolers when they threw that epic party.

Fairy tales. Myths. Lies.

Spoiler alert. Kids are all idiots, and when they’re forced into a life or death situation, they overwhelmingly make stupid decisions and get themselves killed. Like, almost right away. They’re like that rabbit you see sitting on the side of the road that decides to dart in front of your car at the worst possible moment. They’re so efficient at getting themselves squished, you can’t help but wonder if they're doing it on purpose. Go ahead. Complain. Tell me I’m wrong. Trust me on this one. I’ve done some pretty extensive and conclusive research on the matter.

This apotropaic talisman looks like something a goth teenaged girl would shoplift from a Hot Topic. A girl who dreams about one day meeting a hundred-year-old predator and making him fall in love with her.

Remember, it’s not a crime if he’s handsome or rich or looks like a teenager.

Anyway, this bracelet imbues the following effects:

* Protection against Vampirism.
* Protection against Lycanthropy.
* +25% Magical damage against all sapient undead.

Adds 10% Damage Reflect to all equipped armor.

Cancels all Momentum-based attacks.

Made of skin and fur and the spiky things from the back of Thorn Cadavers, these kneepads are both good protection and they’re stylish. Stylish, that is, if your knees are cosplaying as hedgehogs.

== AI Description ==
This is a unique item.

Most children in the universe know the exciting tale of the Leprous Bandit, the infamous human thief whose people were starving to death because of a planet-wide quarantine. While all the planet’s residents were carriers of the disease, it did not affect them. But because the disease was deadly to the Forsoothed, the planet’s regents, the aliens placed themselves in floating protection platforms, guarding the gardens and food stores in hopes to starve the humans all out.

The bandit climbed a mountain, jumped onto a platform, and broke into the floating garden. He was quickly killed, of course, but not before he infected the Forsoothed and caused them to flee the planet. Thanks to the bandit’s intervention, the human planet survived another 100 years before it was obliterated in an unrelated conflict. To this day, the Leprous Bandit remains an inspiration.

== Effects ==
This toe ring imbues the following:

* '''The Sticky Feet Benefit:''' Once every six hours, for (Dexterity x 2) seconds, you may walk upon a non-horizontal surface, such as a wall or ceiling. Gravity will not change, so leave your beer on the ground and make sure you tuck in your shirt first. Your bare feet must be in contact with the surface. No socks, no shoes.
* '''The Super Spreader Benefit:''' You have been given the power of every plague rat and kindergartner since the dawn of time. You may pass any active debuffs onto a target of your choice once per hour. This does not remove the debuff from yourself.

The wearer of this shirt gains +7 to the Regeneration skill. In addition, all melee-based damage debuffs such as Stun, Knockback, Disarm, and Out-of-Breath are negated. The shirt is also quite stylish. Maybe a little too stylish. Unlike most monster-skin apparel items, this shirt will not grant a negative reaction amongst trolls. In fact, lady trolls might just want to haul you away for some one-on-one time if they see you in this.
==Upgrade==
This item has been upgraded once.

Upgrade added a +3 bonus to Dexterity

Item is a wrist bracer that transforms into a spiked war gauntlet made of orcish steel when the hand is shaped into a fist or wields a hilted weapon for more than two seconds at a time. This item on its own does not negate the [[Pugilism Skill|bare knuckle]] skill bonus.

* +3 Strength (In Fist Mode Only)

* 2% chance to Stun enemy upon a successful hit.

'''Warning''': if you use this weapon to strike adherents of the war god Grull, you have a 1.5% chance to transfigure your target into the deity himself. Trust me on this. You don’t want to do that.

After Carl received a [[Platinum Sharpening Stone]], he used it to upgrade the gauntlet to the following:

* +2 Dexterity
* + 2 Skill Levels to Iron Punch.

This enchanted belt offers the following benefits:

* +5% Strength
* +5% Constitution
* +The Avalanche benefit.


'''Avalanche Benefit:''' This benefit is straightforward. If you hit a living creature with your body while you are moving, the force exerted upon that body will be as if they were hit by twice the mass.

*Your entire body must be moving for this benefit to activate. This benefit’s power will not translate to weapons.
*You might want to take this off if you plan on getting busy with someone. Especially if you’re the top

An Error Replacement Net is a technology that was discoverd by the [[Mantis|Mantis's]] a few days before the start of the crawl. It was designed to make the System AI more stable, or, in the AI's words, to lobotomize them.

This skill allows for a crawler to more readily find hidden doors. It also has a hidden benefit that Mordecai was only allowed to explain to Carl due to Donut's [[Manager Benefit]]. It allows access to the Dungeon Locator, a concealed map at major intersections of the dungeon that gives a general overview of what's in every direction. It could point to exits and bosses. On Level 4, it offered a more detailed map of the train line the party was on.

'''Everly''' is a former crawler and author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]]'' (5th Edition).

==Description==
Everly was a crawler thousands of cycles ago and a member of the [[Desperado Club]].  Her team included at least three other crawlers, including a healer, plus additional mercenaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her sponsor, [[Dictum Waystation Controls, Limited]], won her trust by sending her an item that ultimately saved her team.  The next [[Sponsorship Box]] they sent her arrived on the Eighth Floor, and lead to her death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

==Cookbook Entries ==
===On Mercenaries===
&lt;Note Added by Crawler Everly, 5th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''We ended up hiring five [[ mercenaries]]. I got four from the Merc guild on the sixth floor of the Desperado Club, and another party member got a healer from [[Club Vanquisher]]. It was and continues to be a disaster. My guys cost us 1,500 gold a day each, and I’m not sure if it was worth it.'' 

''First off, you have to be very careful with them. If they die, you can’t loot their bodies, and our contract stipulates you have to pay their daily rate for the rest of the damn floor. It’s outrageous. The healer charges per spell cast.'' 

''Second, getting them from one place to the next is difficult if you use a [[Personal Space | personal space]]. It’s easy to lose them. If they leave with me, it’s fine. The door opens, and we walk out together. Otherwise, it automatically defaults to the last place they entered, as if they were a regular crawler. So if they’re not right there with you when you exit, they could end up three or four saferooms away. One of our guys left and never came back. He’s still alive, as I can see him in the chat, but the prick is just wandering around some town having a good ‘ol time and I can’t even fire him because you have to bring them back with you to let them go.''

''Plus their levels mean next to nothing. My level-40 orc is a significantly better fighter than my level-50 dwarf, who is now dead, by the way. Got hit by a chair, of all things, and he died. Twenty-two more days at 1,500 gold a day. The whole thing is a scam.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Butcher's Masquerade: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 5 (pp. 61-62). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|5|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== On Her Death ===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Everly, Fifth Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''My sponsor sent me a box today meant for someone else in my party. And not a crawler, but one of my mercenaries. A spellbook of Hasten Poison. I was quite upset about it. But not five hours later, he used that spell to kill the boss holding the lockbox key, and it saved the lives of us all. I don’t trust my sponsors, but I do trust that they want to keep me alive. As long as I breathe, their insipid advertisements remain on full display, and their investment is intact.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Note added by Crawler Everly, Fifth Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The moment I hit floor eight, they gave me a great box, as if to make up for the previous one. A tool that allows me to take shortcuts through this maze. I really want to hope. To think that there’s good out there. It’s in times like this that there’s a spark in my chitin, a longing for a future that contains warmth and stars.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Note added by Crawler Everly, Fifth Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I take it back. I take it all back. My sponsor was deliberately steering me not toward life, but a death that would be watched and remembered and ultimately heartrending and painful. I was a fool. Fuck you, Dictum Waystation Controls, Limited, whatever that means. I hope your company and all your children die in pain.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Note added by Crawler [[Drakea]]. 22nd Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''This is Everly’s last entry. She did not mention the manner in which she was set up, which is unfortunate. Please, future author. Be as detailed as you can.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Butcher's Masquerade: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 5 (pp. 565-566). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|6|64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Speculation==
*She mentions feeling a "spark in her chitin," suggesting that she is or chose an arthropod class.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You have, with a single attack, killed every last member of a non-unique species on a dungeon’s floor. That’s not an easy thing to do, and it takes a special brand of asshole to pull something like this off.

Species killed: Wall Monitors.

An unknown mechanism using unknown technology, activated by an unknown protocol.

[[Carl]] and [[Donut]] learn about the Fantasy Hunter Camp from [[The Dream]] [[Elf]], [[Akland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He tells them that once a cycle, [[The Dream]] rent the whole moon, allowing their family members and employees to compete for a few days in the simulated hunt. Those who perform best win spots on [[The Dream|The Dream's]] [[Ninth Floor|Faction Wars]] army.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

}}
Ferdinand (actually named "Gravy Boat") is a yellow and orange cat who lived with Marjory on the first floor of Carl's Seattle, WA apartment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description==
An unneutered indoor/outdoor cat, Gravy Boat had impregnated every female cat within three square blocks and would sit outside Carl's second-floor window when Donut was in heat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 19).&lt;/ref&gt;   Bea called him "Ferdinand" before she learned his real name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (epilogue).&lt;/ref&gt;  She called animal control on him twice and screamed at his owner Marjory about his presence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He was outside during the transformation, and was later found -- starving, half-feral -- by Brad and Bea.  Ferdinand returned to New Queen Anne with them, and slept with Bea at night while she sang to him: ''“Good boy, good boy, you’re a good boy, Ferdinand. You’re no Gravy Boat. Oh no, oh no. I’d take it all back and let you in. I’d do it all over again. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Ferdinand. I should have let you in.”''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mercenaries kidnap him from the settlement and turn him over to [[Borant Corporation|Borant]].  Ferdinand is added to the dungeon as a Province Boss and familiar of [[Imogen|Queen Imogen]].  

He was sent down to the 9th floor by the [[Zerzura]] spell along with everyone else inside the high elf castle.  He managed to escape to the city but lost his hat.

==Abilities==
His turban that gives him a lightning spell and be can turn invisible. He's also able to phase jump and has a powerful claw attack.

He rides a rhino as a mount.

*Str - 100

==Introductory Announcement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;Hello, Crawlers. Welcome to the fifth floor! We are so very excited for you to enjoy this new and exciting level! We have just over 178,000 of you joining us. The last floor was somewhat of a mystery, and finding out how it worked was part of the fun. This floor is a little different. The layout is not so much a secret, and the rules are pretty simple. We want you guys to have a great time with this one.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;There are over 4,000 castles on this floor. Every castle contains a single stairwell. No two castles are the same. Think of a sheet of bubble wrap. Every bubble is its own self-contained world. Each individual world has four zones or “quadrants.”&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;There are a total of 1,172 bubbles. All of you are inside of a bubble, equally and randomly distributed the best we could. That comes to a little more than 150 crawlers per bubble. Like with the castles, every bubble is different.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Each bubble is split into four quadrants. Land, Sea, Air, and Subterranean. Each quadrant has a single castle within. Your mission is to find the castle, raid it, and take the throne room. Once the throne room is occupied or the quadrant’s boss is killed, the castle is considered conquered. The stairwell is also located in the throne room, so no need to be scrambling around, worried about not being able to find it. Easy, right? Take the castle, take the stairwell.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;But, there is a small hitch. In order for your stairwell to actually open up and be passable, all four castles in your bubble must first be taken. That’s right, the Land, Sea, Air, and Subterranean castles must all fall in order for you to proceed to the sixth floor.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Luckily for you, once you have taken your own castle, you may traverse outside of your quadrant to lend a hand to your fellow bubble buddies. Once all four castles are taken, the bubble is popped, and you may proceed outside of the bubble area if you wish. You may not enter other bubbles until they are also popped.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Good luck, folks. Some of these castles are much easier to crack than others. Also, the second round of sponsorship bidding is underway. We’ll have another message in a few hours after the regular recap episode. Now get out there and kill, kill, kill!&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You and I have been named co-defendants in an action brought to the Syndicate Court by a third party, and we have been deemed—drum roll please—victorious! Why did they sue us? If you don’t already know why, you probably will never know. This is a rare event, but when it happens, crawlers usually lose these fights since they can’t afford a lawyer, being slaves and all. Plus I’ll throw you under the bus quicker than you can say “Arch Support.” But that doesn’t matter because today, victory is ours! Chalk one up for the little guy!

This is one of the rare achievements that may be awarded more than once.

'''New Quest. Find Out Who Killed My Son.'''

[[Geyrun]] was murdered. Find out who did it and why. My only clue is that the most obvious suspect, my brother [[Hellik]], was in council with the rest of us when it happened. Visit the high cleric at the Emberus Shrine at [[Club Vanquisher]] for additional details.

'''''Time Limit:''''' There is no time limit for this quest. However, you swill receive a smite if you attempt to exit the 18th floor of the world dungeon before this task is complete.

'''''Reward''''': That depends on who did it.


'''Quest Update. Find Out Who Killed My Son.'''

Obtain the item: Memorial Crystal: [[Apito]]. See if this has any bearing on Geyrun's murder. You still need to speak with the high cleric at the Emberus Shrine at Club Vanquisher.

{{Character_info|species=Lesser Demon MILF|level=75|image1=00237y.jpg}}
Fire(wo)man of the Nightmare Express. This is a non-combatant NPC. A single mother's gotta eat!

Where one finds big ovens that need stoking, one will regularly find a Lesser Demon in control. But if it's a fire that needs to be ''extra'' hot, the much rarer Sheol MILFs are often employed to keep those fires sizzling.

Once a pregnant Lesser Demon falls into labor, her delivery usually lasts about sixty days. During these two months, she has a litter of 15-18,000 babies, delivering one approximately every five minutes, non-stop.

Only one in 10,000 Lesser Demon babies are viable. The rest rarely live more than a few seconds. Their corpses shrivel and harden, becoming a valuable resource called Sheol Bricks. The 15th floor will be lousy with them. If exposed to fire, Sheol Bricks burn long and hot. Lesser Demon MILFs who also learn water magic can find lucrative work as steam boiler fire stokers. Once they seal themselves within the boiler, they create an almost self-sufficient system that keeps most larger boilers humming. Plus it's a convenient way of disposing of their failed young.

'''The First Floor''' is accessed from the [[Dungeon Entrance | surface-level staircases]] that populate the Earth after the [[Transformation]], and is considered a [[Tutorial | tutorial floor]].  Located beneath the Earth's surface, it is a sprawling, grid-like network of passages and tunnels that look like they were hewn out of rock.  The vast level is split into sections that are not connected, so crawlers originating in China cannot interact with crawlers from the USA.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__
== Introductory Announcement ==
[[Cascadia]] makes the introductory announcement after the stairwells from the surface close, one hour after the Dungeon opens.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Hello, Crawlers! The dungeon is now sealed. We have a diverse group joining us this season, and we are very happy to have you here. We had just under 13 million human crawlers make it through the gates and into the dungeon. We are already down to under 10 million. A quick note, the entrances to the second floor will not open up until the introductory episode of Dungeon Crawler World tunnels, which will be in approximately 30 of your hours. Once that happens, the entrances to the second level will populate. There will be no lag time for the appearance of additional levels. On behalf of the [[Borant Corporation]] I wanted to thank you for volunteering, and I wish you all good luck and a happy crawl."''&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 44). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Special Mechanics ==
'''1.''' [[Tutorial Guild Hall | Tutorial Guild Halls]] liberally populate the first floor.  Crawlers '''must''' complete the [[Tutorial]] to receive full access to their [[HUD / Crawler Menu | HUD and Crawler Menus]], and to be assigned to a [[Game Guide]].

'''2.''' The First Floor cannot be viewed by live viewers of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' (unless they have a press pass); instead, it is summarized by [[Dungeon Crawler World: Earth | Borant's highlight reels]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Layout ==
The First Floor is a network of halls and tunnels organized in a giant square grid.  Each equally-sized square is bordered by wide passageways and intersected by twisty, maze-like halls and tunnels laid out like a condensed version of the city above.  

The first main artery that Carl finds is dimly illuminated by torches and approximately 30' W x 30' H (9.14m x 9.14m), stretching as far as he can see.  Alleyways of various widths and heights branch from its walls; some alleys are hewn from smooth stone, others are shrouded in absolute darkness, and others have "green, lichen-like growths" glowing on dark red brick walls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various halls are humid and stuffy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bosses ===
Each square contains four neighborhoods, each with its own area-specific mob and neighborhood boss.  The mobs range in level from 1 to 5, and neighborhood bosses (which are typically caricatures of an earth stereotype mashed together with the local mob) range from level 7 to 9.   Mobs stop spawning in a neighborhood after the boss is killed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{ref|1|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

All Borough Bosses and City Bosses on the level have a stairwell in their arena, but many of the 75,000 stairwells randomly distributed across the level can be accessed without a boss battle.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{ref|1|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borough Bosses appear to encompass a full square grid.  No City Bosses are defeated on the first floor.

=== Restrooms ===
Restrooms (with one complimentary roll of toilet paper) appear roughly every 0.25 mile (0.4 km).  The doorways seem to have been stolen from commercial building restrooms around the world and still bear men/women symbols or handwritten signs; however, the mismatched doors always open to the exact same cramped bathroom stall.  [[Carl | Carl's]] restroom contains a silver toilet and a roll of toilet paper; [[Donut | Princess Donut's]] contains a litterbox.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ref|1|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safe Rooms===
Safe Rooms appear every few miles.  On the first floor, these take the form of fast food restaurants and rest areas teleported from Earth's surface: a Peruvian Taco Bell, a Waffle House from Alabama, etc.   Some safe rooms are full-service dining areas staffed by [[Bopca Protector]] non-combatant NPCs, but smaller safe rooms may have once-per-day servings of [[Experience Cookies]] or +1 DEX candies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ref|1|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Safe Room bathrooms may include showers and amenities, or only toilet stalls.  Some Safe Rooms have rooms to rent (for free), while others have a few cots to sleep on and maybe a curtain for privacy.  All Safe Rooms have three main screens: the first shows the current crawler count, the second airs ''Dungeon Crawler World'', and the third contains information specific to the room.

== Loot ==
The first two floors are designed to load crawlers up with a variety of loot so that they can experiment with possible builds. By the time a crawler arrives on the [[Third Floor]], they should have a good idea of what class and race will work for them.

On the first floor, low-tier [[Loot Boxes]] commonly contain torches and bandages.  Mobs drop skins, organs, and other items that can be used in [[:Category:Crafting|crafting]] later.

== Description ==
Upon the Earth's seizure by the Borant Corporation, Florin was one of the nearly 13 million individuals that chose to descend into the newly created World Dungeon, and in doing so, become a Crawler. As a Crawler, Florin became a participant in the Universal Reality Series "Dungeon Crawler World". If Florin, or any other Crawler, is successful in completing all 18 levels of the World Dungeon, a feat that has never been done, he will be free to exercise his right of resource reclamation by reclaiming regency of the planet.

Florin is described as having a mysterious background, stating that he was originally from France yet had an Australian accent. At the time of the World Dungeon's opening, Florin had been in Africa working "private security". He entered the dungeon "armed to the teeth", but came to mostly rely on a heavily modified automatic shotgun that he brought with him. This shotgun would become his primary form of offense after it became magically modified to create and hold unlimited ammunition. 

During the "Recap Episode" upon the opening of level 3, it was discovered that Florin had begun traveling with fellow Crawler, Ifechi. Florin and Ifechi became a party at some point after Ifechi lost her entire party to a City Boss slime monster. Florin and Ifechi begin dating. 

At the conclusion of the 4th Floor, Florin and [[Ifechi]] are confronted by [[Lucia Mar]]. When Florin tries to shoot her, she uses a redirection spell to make the blast hit Ifechi instead, killing her. Florin spends most of the 5th Floor despondent, until [[Elle McGib|Elle]] and [[Imani C|Imani]] convince him to keep going, when he finally entered the quadrent he found that everyone in the bubble was already dead.

''Your party has been designated Host of this Group Quest. As hosts, you will not be allowed to opt-out from this quest.''

What the hell is going on? Am I glad you asked!

A while back a certain NPC started casting a very powerful spell, a spell so potent, that it had to be completed by a future generation.

Here's the thing with old spells. They're like trees. They grow. They get big. Sometimes huge. Bad shit happens when they get screwed up. The bigger the spell, the badder the shit. And boy was this spell big. Not gonna lie. Your favorite AI was looking forward to it going off.

Oh well. This will be almost as good.

Shit is about to go down. For example, you may have noticed every Skyfowl and Chickadee NPC in the area has fallen ill. Most of them have already plunged into a coma, or death. It's not their fault, but they were tied to the spell, and that's just the way it is.

Just like it's not your fault that you happen to be within 45 kilometers of the fallout from this failed spell. Again, not your fault. (Well, unless you're Crawlers [[Carl]], [[Donut|Princess Donut]], or [[Katia Grim]]. Then it is your fault.) That's just the way it is. Sucks to be you.

There's going to be an explosion. The epicenter of the blast is marked on your map. Every crawler within the designated blast area is fucked.

The object of the quest is simple. Unfuck yourself. Don't die.

Warning: This is an event quest. If you do not want to participate in this quest, you will have sixty seconds from the end of this message to get yourselves into a saferoom. After that, all access to saferooms within the quest zone will be shut off until the event quest is concluded. All NPCs who remain indoors, saferoom or not, will remain safe. All mobs and neighborhood-level boss monsters within the blast radius subject to both physical and magical explosions will be killed.

'''''Reward''':'' All participants who survive will receive a [[Quest Box|Platinum Quest Box]].

Oh, by the way. The explosion is coming in seven minutes.

'''''Run'''''.


'''Quest Update'''

You've probably noticed you're not dead. Everybody say, "Thank you Crawler Carl." I'll give you a second to luxuriate in your victory.

That's the good news, You might want to sit down for this next part.

The bad news is there's still an explosion coming. A bigger bang, actually, but the area of effect will be similar. I won't bore you guys with the technical details, but what you just felt is called a precursor burst. It's a foreshock. The first of four before the big show. The one you just felt temporarily removed the magical properties of all your equipped gear. The next one will do something different.

All of this will culminate with a burst of pure, wild magic much more potent than the magically-infused chemical explosion from which you guys were just spared. Less physical damage to the environment. More face melting. I prefer this, if we're being honest. Have you ever put a marshmallow in a microwave? Imagine your head as the marshmallow. It'll be kinds like that. Prepare your defenses accordingly.

You now have twenty minutes to save yourselves.

== Description ==
Author of the 20th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].

== Cookbook Entries ==
Confirmed. Works with bombs but smoke works better. Doesn't kill high-level undead, but the get mad. I use these to clear rooms of those invisible Swamp Wights. (Chapter 8, Book 3. Comment added to Crawler Sinjin's note about soaking hobgoblin smoke bombs in healing potions to use against undead.)

Backpacks now only slow destabilization now, not negate it. Found that out the hard way. Rest well, little sister. I pray those who read this kill an enemy in her honor today. That is all we can do, no? Her name was Barkith, and she was all I had left. I feel lost, but I will persevere. (Chapter 13, Book 3)

They [the gods] may be invulnerable, but they still feel pain. They still bleed. The drivers of these bodies suffer. In honor of my sister, I pray I make it to the 12th floor just so I may slay one. I know this is but a dream, but I will look in the god's eyes and say to him, "This is for Barkith. This is for my sister." (Chapter 32, Book 3)

Based on some of these previous passages and my own observations, I think I've put together a good idea about the layout of [[Sixth Floor|The Hunting Grounds]]. They say it's the same every time, but that is not true. [[Herot]] spoke of those tall creatures who bellow into sky each night, rumbling the world. [[Azin]] described the kite birds always flying overhead. [[Ikicha]] wrote of the ice and cold weather. None of those are here, not in this iteration. Most of the world is jungle. That is a constant. But the monsters within change, so be careful taking advice from previous editions of this book regarding this floor. However, the map appears to be the same each time. The "political" landscape" is the same, too. It is a round world with a single named metropolis and dozens of other unnamed cities of varying sizes like on [[Third Floor|the third floor]]. This world, according to the story, was half metropolis and half jungle before Scolopendra's nine-tier attack, whatever the hell that even means. After the attack, most everyone died, and the jungle ran rampant, swallowing the ruins. However, after a few hundred years, the survivors have started to rebuild. The named city is always in the same place. In the north, near the edge of the map and overlooking a clear valley filled with lower-level monsters, placed there so the hunters can train while the crawlers make their way through the lower floors. All the way to the southeast is the high elf city, which is in the thickest part of the jungle. Stay away from the elves. They are powerful magic users, and they attack everyone. Even the hunters stay away. Before the cataclysm, this world was rich. The city was under control of a multi-race council. The jungle was under control of the high elves. They hated each other, but there was mostly peace. A river separated the two districts. That river still winds through the map. There are bridges at regular intervals. Stay out of the water. The Naiads live within and are just as bad as the elves. The named city - whose name appears to be different each  time - will always be under control of a single race, It doesn't matter which one. The moment the hunters arrive, one of them always hunts down and kills the NPC leader, which gives them control. I think it's the only city they're allowed to do this in, otherwise they'd have control of them all by the time we arrive. Either way, once the floor opens, the low-level valley will be hunted to extinction, the existing government of the named city will have been wiped out, and one of the hunters will have set themselves up as Grand, the title given to mayors of the biggest settlements. Stay out of the big city. The guards will attack you on sight. (Chapter 5, Book 5)

Former Child Actor is [[Donut|Donut's]] main class which she selects during class selection on the third floor. It grants her the [[Character Actor]] skill which allows her to select another class for each floor. Critically it also grants the [[Manager Benefit]] and this is the real reason she chose it. [[Odette]] had recommended Donut chose a class with the manager benefit so that [[Mordecai]] would become their managar.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
| quote = CARL ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? HE IS GOING TO BE REALLY MAD.
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;small&gt;[[Donut | Princess Donut]] (Book 3, Chapter 1)&lt;/small&gt;
}}

[[Zev]] later comments that most viewers are happy with [[Carl]] and [[Donut|Donut's]] class/race choices. She says some people are complaining that Former Child Actor doesn't allow for growth but that most think it off-sets the training required for Carl's [[Primal]] race.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== AI Description ==
This rare subclass is an offshoot of the Character Actor class. It can only be obtained by Crawlers who have both received the “[[Cut!]]” achievement and have obtained at least one trillion views.

Once a spoiled brat superstar, then addicted to drugs, you have crawled back from the brink stronger than ever. You are ready for your comeback. This Charisma and Chance-based class could go either way. You’ll either rise to the top, or you’ll be dead in a ditch in a week.

This unique Earth class is based on the Bard/Rogue Jack-Of-All-Trades subclass, but with a few distinctive differences.

In addition to the following benefits, the most distinct aspect of this multi-faceted class is the Level-3 [[Character Actor]] skill. This skill increases in level only upon descent to the next floor.

Additional benefits:

* Immunity to all poisons and diseases.
* Level-5 [[Cockroach]] skill.
* +10 to Charisma.
* +15% faster growth in all Charisma-based skills.
* The [[Manager Benefit]]

This is an Earth Class. As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver [[Earth Box]] upon choosing this class.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Once an attraction at Grimaldi's Traveling Circus on the [[Third Floor|third floor]], Former Circus Lemurs were transformed into knife-throwing mobs by [[Scolopendra]]'s curse. 

==AI Description==
'''Former Circus Lemur – Level 8''' 

'''Grimaldi’s Traveling Circus was one of the Over City’s favorite attractions before that fateful day so long ago. Hundreds of years later, the feral and transformed descendants of that circus still stalk the ruins, seeking out adults and children alike to dazzle and entertain.'''

'''And by dazzle and entertain, we mean devour the flesh from their bones and use their remains as armor.''' 

'''Grimaldi’s Amazing Juggling Lemurs were one of the circus’s key attractions. Children from all over the realm would laugh and clap as they watched these funny little creatures juggle all manner of items, from balls to pins to knives.''' 

'''You can probably guess where this is going.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 40; chapter 4). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The red-furred lemurs wear black and red-painted human skulls to cover their own furless, skinless faces and bulbous blood-shot eyes.  Their bandoliers contain six or more throwing knives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed stealth ability makes them invisible on a crawler's minimap until the crawler actually lays eyes on them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   They appear to travel in groups and either stake out high vantage points, waiting for unsuspecting targets, or ride along on artillery giraffes that then fling the lemurs like bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dropped Loot==

*Poor lemur skin
*Small bandolier with throwing knives&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Iron Tangle.jpg|thumb|The Iron Tangle, created by a listener (WIP) (unofficial)]]
The Fourth Floor is called the Iron Tangle because it consists entirely of thousands of interconnected subway tunnels. Each tunnel has a color designation or unique name an has one or more trains running in a loop.

Train stations are located up and down the lines. At some stops mobs board or exit the train; some contain safe rooms. There are also transfer stations where crawlers can transfer to different lines.

When trains get to the end of the line they are portaled to either a train yard where they are readied for another loop or to the abyss - a giant pit where wreckage is discarded.

== Introductory Announcement ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;Hello Crawlers. Welcome to the fourth floor!&lt;/small&gt;'' 

''&lt;small&gt;We are so very excited to introduce you to what is being hailed a genius feat of engineering. We call it the Iron Tangle. The trick is to find the stairwells. There are a lot of them out there, but where? Let's see how many of you figure it out.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;This is important. This is not a permanent change, but it is a new rule for this level only&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;'' ''&lt;small&gt;You may not go down early this level. The stairwells will open six hours prior to collapse, and that's it. Again, you may not go down early this floor. Now have fun out there. These train things are so nifty. We never had anything like it on our world.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;Patron bidding is active, and we are very happy with the results so far. You will get a notification when your bidding has concluded. We'll have more info on that later.&lt;/small&gt;''

''&lt;small&gt;You will notice that the leaderboard has finally populated. Congratulations to everybody on the list. As you can see, each member of the top 10 has a bounty after their names. That means hunting season is&lt;/small&gt;'' &lt;small&gt;open''! Isn't that exciting? If you kill one, you will receive a loot box containing the reward. If you are on the leaderboard, don't worry, you get to join in on the fun too. If you survive the floor, you will receive 10% of your own bounty upon floor collapse. That percentage goes up each floor.''&lt;/small&gt;

''&lt;small&gt;Finally, we'd like to address the especially high mortality rate of the third floor. This occurred due to a high instance of group quests gone bad. While the number of crawlers are still in the acceptable range, we are all concerned about early extinction. That does not mean we will be letting up. So quit sucking. It's as simple as that.&lt;/small&gt;''

Usually reserved for monk classes and those too soused to reliably dress themselves, recipients of this benefit receive an additional 100% damage bonus to all attacks that originate below the waist. In addition, all skills that originate from below the waist train 20% faster. But as the name implies, this benefit allows only a single layer of armor or clothing to cover your crotch area. And since you’re already wearing these, it looks like you won’t be getting trousers anytime soon.

It was released in America in September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982, ''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' stated that "''Frogger'' has earned the ominous distinction of being 'the arcade game with the most ways to die'."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Gary and Marcia (November 1982). "Frogger". ''Softline''. p. 19. &lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the game is to guide each of three, five, or seven frogs (depending on game settings) from the bottom of the screen to their empty homes at the top of the screen.  The frogs must cross a horizontal road full of speeding vehicles, and then jump from log to log across an alligator-infested pond to reach their homes.   When all frogs are in their home, the game progresses to the next level; each level is progressively more difficult, although the difficulty briefly eases every five levels.

      <text bytes="4775" sha1="4nqyvc0ojymui5xe5rss54r52fsvud1" xml:space="preserve">'''Game Guides''' are noncombatant NPCs who serve as guildmasters of [[Tutorial Guild Hall|Tutorial Guild Halls]] on the [[First Floor|first]], [[Second Floor|second]], and [[Third Floor|third]] floors of the [[Dungeon]].    They are typically former crawlers who took indentured servitude "deals" to exit previous Dungeons sponsored by the host company, and the current season only counts against their indentureship if one of their crawlers reaches the Fourth Floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 29).&lt;/ref&gt;    

When a crawler meets a guildmaster, the infobox pop-up provides the guildmaster's name, race, class, level, and the description, formatted as:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;Mordecai – Rat Hooligan. Level 50.&lt;/small&gt;'''&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Guildmaster of this guildhall.'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''This is a Non-Combatant NPC.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 25). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Game Guides can be permanently killed in the Dungeon&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 15).&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to stay in safe rooms.

==Responsibilities==
As guildmasters, they are responsible for teaching new crawlers how to use their [[HUD / Crawler Menu|HUD and Crawler Menus]] during the [[Tutorial|tutorial]].  Once a guildmaster successfully trains a new crawler, the guildmaster is registered as that crawler's game guide.  Any time the crawler enters a training guild on the first three floors, the crawler will be transported to their game guide's guild.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;   

Game Guides have access to the [[codex]], but do not have access to the chat feature.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  They cannot be watched by live viewers.   They are able to share limited information about the Dungeon, but are restricted by a specific set of rules to prevent cheating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  After their crawler engages in a battle, they can review the fight notes and give tips to help the crawler improve and better understand the Dungeon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 25).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning halfway through the Second Floor, Game Guides may begin instructing Crawlers about the Third Floor and race and class selection.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 44).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the Third Floor, Game Guides must help crawlers through class and race selection without overtly telling them what to do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   After the selection process is complete, the Game Guide exits the guild hall -- dressed in formalwear -- with the crawler and formally presents the crawlers to the live viewers:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;“I’d like to present Dungeon Crawler Carl, the Level 13 Compensated Anarchist Primal. Welcome, Carl, to the third floor.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 30). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Crawlers lose access to their Game Guides as soon as they reach the Fourth Floor.

==Preparations==

Guildmasters spend years preparing for each new season of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]].''  In [[Carl]]'s season, which takes place in either 2017 or 2023 (see notes on [[Dungeon]] and [[The Transformation|Transformation]] pages), the advance teams arrived on Earth in 1937 and [[Mordecai]] began the prep phase in 1964.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;  Preparations include consuming popular media and learning the planet's customs.  In previous years, Guildmasters received a newsletter every few cycles; however, Borant Corporation discontinued the newsletter to cut costs and did not notify Guildmasters that the season was opening two years early.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;“Guildmasters prepare for years for each new dungeon world. Kid, I have been preparing for this longer than you have been alive. The advance team arrived in your 1930s, I believe. Whenever that book came out, ''The Hobbit''. I left the last system and entered the prep phase in your year 1964. I know this world and your customs just as well as you do. I even once got to shapeshift into a human and go out into the world. I went to a Blockbuster Video and stole a bunch of James Bond tapes. I was so happy once you guys started digitizing everything.”&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (pp. 34-35). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Description ==
A celestial item that opens a gate from one place to another, this includes other floors but doesn't allow crawlers to travel down without using a staircase. The cost is ripping a hole in the [[Nothing]] and summon an ancient, feral god. Usually when one of those is summoned, another god comes looking for it. The gate comes in three pieces: two watches and a winding box. 

When it was created by the AI, it set off a chain reaction of checks and balances that crashed the entire system, effectively allow it to circumvent it’s own rules. 

Multiple factions sue to keep this item out of Carl's hands, but they were [[Fight the Power!|unsuccessful]].

'''New Quest! Get Orthrus.'''

This is a world quest! All living crawlers on the fifth floor will receive this message!

''Now'' it's a party.

[[Orthrus]], the two-headed puppy is bounding his way happily through the Lacuna, the world that houses the bubbles. This very adorable pup is running back to his former master's father. Don't worry. You can't miss him. He just drenched the folks in bubble 331, and then he knocked down the Sounder Tower in bubble 298.

What a menace!

Let's kill it.

'''''Reward''''': Any crawler who kills this cute puppy before he reunites with grandpa will receive the following:

* One million gold pieces.
* Five level-up potions.
* A pet monkey named Jimbo.

Current participants in the "[[Dumber of the Flunkies]]" group quest are free to kill the puppy if they are sadistic assholes, but they will not receive the rewards. You know what, never mind. They get the prize, too!

{{Character_info|species=Human|occupation=Glass Mage|first_appearance=Chapter 21, Book 4|level=43|status=Deceased, turned to sand after being killed by Katia}}
Ghazi - Human. Level 43 Glass Mage

Known by most everyone in the area as the Mad Dune Mage, Ghazi came to the area for the same reason as the bugbear captain, [[Shamus Chaindrive]]: to seek out the hidden treasure that is said to be buried within the Necropolis of Anser.

As a glass mage who specializes in the study of both transmutation and the teleportation of energized particles, Ghazi told his colleagues at the [[Larracos]] College of Magecraft that he was seeking out the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]] to study its potential use in stable, long-distance transportation.

This was, in fact, a lie.

His real purpose in seeking out the fabled artifact was for reliable, controlled access to the [[Nothing]] in order to converse with [[Yarilo]], the banished god of Lust. He sought but a simple boon in exchange for freeing the god.

Ghazi wished for [[Yarilo]] to make the famed [[Lika]] fall in love with him.

Lika is a half-naiad trobairitz. A trobairitz is a bard cleric who has taken a vow of celibacy. She is also the fictional main character of a popular series of stage plays that are often performed in the Larracos stage district. She was never real, and is very loosely based on a minor deity. She has been portrayed by dozens of half-naiad thespians over the years.

In other words, Ghazi was trying to summon a god to turn his waifu into the real deal.

Funny thing about summoning creatures from within the Nothing. They're all crazy. They all want out. Some of them are very good at pretending they're somebody they are not.

Yadda, yadda, yadda. The entity Ghazi summoned is not Yarilo. And now the glass mage is trapped in his now-transformed castle, cursed with the knowledge what he's done and what he's unleashed onto the world.

He has an escape. He is too much of a coward to do it. But there is one thing that will throw him over the edge. You probably don't want that to happen.

'''Glory Bound''' is a highly dangerous and addictive drug available in the [[Dungeon]].

==Description==
Like [[Blitz Sticks]] but stronger, Glory Bound puts you in a coma and allows you to relive a memory.  

Unfortunately, if taken once, you will slowly lose your mind and become unable to differentiate between "then" and "now" if you can't get more. The only cure is a bad trip of Glory Bound that makes you relive your worst memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gnomish Drop Bears''' are open-air biplanes created by [[Gnomes]].  They are used by the Dirigible Gnomes in [[Fifth Floor]] Bubble #543.

== AI Description==
Gnomish Drop Bear. Contraption. 

This is one of the Dirigible Gnome’s earliest fast-attack planes. There are only a handful of these still in service. While able to quickly reach most targets when drop-launched from home base, the twin engines of these early models were famously underpowered. Damaged Drop Bears oftentimes had difficulty obtaining enough altitude to reach home, even after ditching their payload. This is why most of these planes carry rapid-deploying, quick-escape balloons, making them sitting targets for enemy aircraft and flak. 

That information is not going to do you any good when you’re sitting there on the ground watching this thing barrel at you like a robin descending upon a glistening, fat worm. 

Don’t worry, these guys don’t drop bombs. Their standard payload is something much more entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Gate of the Feral Gods: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 4 (pp. 51-52). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Gnomish Drop Bears look like open-air, twin-engine biplanes, with each engine nestled between the wings, and look like they were built out of scrap metal.  The planes may be decorated with paint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Their payload is egg-shaped and only slightly smaller than a refrigerator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Gnomish Drop Bears are fueled by gasoline.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|4|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Air Quadrant of [[Fifth Floor]] Bubble #543, a number of these dangle from the underbelly of Gnomish airships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==AI Description==
'''Gnomish Knock-Knock''' 

'''Type: Fuel-air bomb.''' 

'''Effect: Thermobaric Explosion.''' 

'''Status: 40. Barely stable. I wouldn’t be tapping on the thing.''' 

'''Ever seen a hundred Dromedarians die because their lungs imploded, followed by their skin getting melted off their body just before they all shatter into mist? Well now’s your chance! Fun for the whole family, this was the main weapon of the Gnomish Bombardier Squads. There are only a few of these things left, and they’re usually strapped to the failing air force’s most reliable patrol ships.''' 

'''The fuel-air Knock-Knocks were once used to devastating effect in the early days of the last conflict. The remaining munitions are instead used as a mutual-standoff weapon. These are simple, crude, but highly-effective bombs. They are detonated using an adjustable, pressure-based fuse that can allow the bombardier to fine-tune the height at which they explode. Requires the bomber to know the altitude of their target to obtain maximum efficacy.''' 

'''Famously unstable. But god-damn do they put on a show.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Gate of the Feral Gods: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 4 (pp. 36-37). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Category:Loot Boxes]]
The Goblin Box is a [[:Category:Loot Boxes|Loot Box]] awarded for using [[Goblins|goblin]] explosives on the [[First Floor|first]] and [[Second Floor|second]] Floors, and generally contain more explosives.   Carl receives similar loot items in unspecified boxes on the Third Floor.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 13).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the second Silver Goblin Box, Carl does not identify the tier of the goblin boxes he receives.

The boxes appear to be haphazardly assembled with bits of metal, colored by tier, and have a goblin skull etched onto the lid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver Goblin Box ==
Carl receives several Silver Goblin Boxes on the first two floors.   The very first box contained the [[Goblin Pass]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The boxes typically include three line items of loot.

=== Sample Loot ===

* Goblin Dynamite x 5
* [[Goblin Pass]]
* [[Goblin Smoke Bombs]]&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 19).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lighter
* Satchel of Gunpowder

=== Related Achievements ===

* [[Boom|Boom!]]
* an unnamed achievement for killing more than 10 mobs with an explosive.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

You will know. Just listen to the chopper. It will tell you.”&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. Dungeon Crawler Carl: A LitRPG/Gamelit Adventure (p. 132). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The '''Goblin Chopper Copper''' is a [[Goblins|Goblin]]-made motorcycle running on a steam engine.  It has a sidecar fit for a princess.

==AI Description==
'''Goblin Copper Chopper with attached sidecar. Human-sized. Contraption.'''

'''Take a junkyard bicycle, add an unreliable steam engine, remove all the bolts holding it together, replace them with chewing gum, and you get the idea. The preferred assault transport of Goblin Bomb Bards, what this contraption lacks in reliability and safety it makes up for in absolutely nothing.'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The framework is seemingly welded from mismatched copper scrap, and a thumping steam engine sits in the middle of the chassis.  The seat appears to be an alligator skull with white fur on top. The sturdy black wheels are made of some unknown material, more disc than tire.

The detachable sidecar is little more than a bar, a single wheel on a massive spring, and a smaller flat-headed, fur-lined orc skull as a seat. The backrest is painted purple and has an extra layer of fur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Operation==
The steam engine runs on a permacube, rather than on a lesser demon, so it will operate as long as it has fuel to heat it.  A hopper extends from the engine to the handlebars, allowing the rider to toss coal in as needed to heat the permacube.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At a rough speed of 20mph, the hopper will need 3-4 lumps of coal per mile (60 - 80 per hour).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To start the engine, the rider needs to pedal the chopper like a bicycle to reach their desired speed (max of 25 mph&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;), then turn the throttle to stay locked at the speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the engine's heat, the rider will need to hold their legs out to prevent burning. As the operator's '''Chopper Pilot Skill''' level increases, they can use the throttle to adjust the bike's speed, rather than the pedals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pressure and heat can be further controlled by twisting spigots on the side of the bike; one reduces heat to prevent the engine from blowing, and the other reduces pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Story==
[[Carl]] commissions the Goblins to make the chopper on the [[First Floor]], as a way to navigate the winding tunnels more easily and cover ground quickly. For a while, it is the second most valuable item in his inventory, just behind the [[Wisp Armor Spell | Tome of Wisp Armor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chopper is instrumental in Carl's plan to save [[Meadow Lark]] from the [[Rage Elemental]], but is destroyed in the process.

The '''Murder Dozer''' is a [[Goblins | Goblin]]-made coal-powered contraption found on [[First Floor | the First Floor]].

==AI Description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'''A goblin-built, steam-powered machine designed to mow down and slaughter unsuspecting dungeon crawlers. I hope you're up to date with your tetanus shot.'''''"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The tractor-sized Murder Dozer is haphazardly constructed of rusting hunks of metal, runs on tank-like treads, and has several pipes billowing out black smoke.  A spinning wheel covered in spikes whirrs on the front of the machine, and there's a small ladder on the back.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It sounds like a steam engine and has a wide turn radius.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The top of the machine is a fur-lined recessed hole with benches enough to seat fifteen goblins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Goblin Shamans may enchant Murder Dozers so that, in the event of a boiler breach, the focused energy of the blast targets the nearest non-goblin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Notes ==
When encountering creatures considered "natural goblin enemies," the [[System AI|AI]] is kind enough to include a warning in the initial summary.  The text changes to specify whether the hostile entity is a mob or an NPC.&lt;blockquote&gt;'''WARNING: This is a fairy-class mob.

Goblins are a race of small green humanoids that are common antagonists in fantasy and tabletop games.  They are present on the [[First Floor|first floor]], and were the first enemies [[Carl]] encountered in the [[Dungeon|World Dungeon]]. 

== Description==
Small and reckless, the Dungeon's goblins are associated with explosions and unstable contraptions.  Crawlers who receive explosion-related achievements earn [[Goblin Box|Goblin Loot Boxes]] containing ever-unstable [[goblin dynamite]] and goblin smoke bombs, and may earn skill points in the "Goblin Explosives" skill.

Goblins live in clans lead by a War Chieftain or - occasionally - Goblin Warlord.  Goblin Shamans (or Shamankas) specialize in Anguish Magic, and serve as the leader's second-in-commands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  If a crawler kills only one goblin in a group, the others will return shortly after with the rest of the clan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Their guttural language sounds like grunts and squeaks, and their laughter is high-pitched and squealing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Dungeon Crawler Carl'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Green-hued humanoid creatures that stand approximately 4 ft (1.2 meters) tall&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, goblins are mostly bald and have "pointed ears, angular faces, and sharp teeth."  On the [[First Floor|first floor]], the goblins are unarmored and clothed in leathery rags.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Classes==
There are several variations of Goblins that appear in the World Dungeon with various attributes.

=== Goblin (No Class)===
AI Description: &lt;blockquote&gt;"'''Small, green and smart. What Goblins lack in physical strength they make up in pure spunk'''.''"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dungeon Crawler Carl: A LitRPG/Gamelit Adventure by Matt Dinniman. pg.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Lower level goblins are the most common class of goblin on the [[First Floor|first floor]].  They are armed with wooden sticks with pineapples at the end.

===Goblin Engineer===
AI Description: &lt;blockquote&gt;"'''Engineers. The incels of the goblin world. They have a hard time finding a date, which makes them extra angry. If there are any females in you party, they will attack them first.'''''"''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Goblin engineers seem to be responsible for creating and maintaining the goblins various constructs.  The first Goblin Engineer that Carl meets is driving the Goblin Murder Dozer and carries a small, curved blade.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Dungeon Crawler Carl'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;   All goblin engineers wear something odd on their heads, whether a pot, a hockey helmet, or boxers' headgear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Goblin Bomb Bard ===
[[File:01031.png|thumb|Goblin Bomb Bard by Sandboy OC]]
AI Description:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''"These bastards are more unhinged and sadistic than those guys who couldn’t pass the psych exam to join the military. Bomb Bards are experts with explosives, and they strike with a variety of ranged attacks that’ll blow your socks off. If the one you’re looking at right now has more than half of his fingers, then he’s probably very, very dangerous."'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When preparing for battle, the bomb bards wear metal helmets with a spike at the top; the spike shoots sparks, allowing the bomb bards to light dynamite sticks and bombs by raising them over their heads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goblin Shamanka &amp; Goblin Shaman ===
AI Description:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''"In case you’re wondering, Shamanka is just a fancy way of saying female shaman. Goblin Shamans are the leader class of all goblin clans, second only to the War Chieftain or, more rarely, the Goblin Warlord. They are without humor and are said, as part of their training, to have to pick two of the following three actions in order to graduate Shamanka University: they have to fuck, cook, and/or eat their own parents. Most don’t pick cook. And if that wasn’t messed up enough, they specialize in [[Anguish Magic]], a dark magic school designed to focus and enhance damage from other attacks."'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Shamankas are marked by heavy facial piercings and black robes.  Their wooden staffs are topped with carved pineapples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Goblin Engineering==
Goblin steam engines run on coal, but use a [[permacube]] rather than a lesser demon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''War God Grull. Level 250.'''

'''Sponsored by [[Maestro|Prince Maestro]] of [[the Skull Empire]]'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. He is invulnerable on this floor.'''

''This god has been involuntarily summoned to this location. Summoning rules apply.''

The child of [[Taranis]] and [[Apito]], Grull, the god of war, is one of the few trueborn heirs to the [[Celestial Ascendancy]]. But with an angry streak as long as a horse's cock, Tanaris worries his son may not be the best choice to rule the heavens. Plus his worshippers tend to be donkeys and other equine-themed creatures. It's a bit unsettling, even to a god.

Grull cannot die. But even if he could, would it really matter? At level 250, he could raze this entire floor in a day.

I hope you said your prayers and brought the lube, because you about to get fucked from here to eternity.

== AI Description ==


Unlike a revolutionary who stands front and center, you take your fight to the jungles. You cease to be the face of the revolution and instead become the tip of the sword. Using your superior trap-making and ranged-weapon skills, you kill the enemy before they even know you’re there. 

Guerillas receive the following benefits: 

* An additional +1 to dexterity upon level-up
* Access to the Advanced Trap Maker’s Workshop.
* Plus [[Camouflage]]
* +5 to the Crossbow skill.
* Faster trap-making training.

==Basic Guilds==
To start a Guild, a crawler needs to purchase a '''Guild Charter''' for 500,000+ gold from a [[Bopca Protector]]. 

The basic level one guild can include up to five separate parties or individuals, as long as at least one member in each [[Party]] already owns a [[Personal Space]].  After the guild is formed, a new room labelled '''Guild Common Area''' is added to all associated personal spaces.  The crawler's existing personal and party spaces are still restricted to party members only.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guild Leaders / Guildmaster==
Each Guild has a '''Guild Leader''' who controls guild membership and can assign administration rights to members, such as the power to edit the common area or purchase common upgrades.  Guild Leaders may choose to charge membership fees and create a guild treasury.

==Guild Upgrades==
Guild upgrades can be purchased.  

*Most personal space environmental upgrades can be shared with other guild members for a small licensing fee.
*Guild-wide experience sharing can be purchased.

'''Gustavo''' is a rottweiler, and one of [[Lucia Mar]]'s [[Pets &amp; Dungeon Familiars | dungeon familiars]].  

==Description==
Gustavo entered the [[Dungeon]] in Ecuador with Lucia Mar and another rottweiler, [[Cici]].  The three feature heavily on the second episode of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' sixty hours later, which shows the young teenager already kitted out with a full set of enchanted armor, Cici equipped with a chainmail sweater, and Gustavo 3 shooting lightning when he barks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler = While both dogs generate a great deal of carnage, Gustavo is particularly violent. He blocks a crawler from accessing the stairwell on the [[Fourth Floor]], and "accidentally" slaughters Lucia's new friends on the [[Fifth Floor]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Spoiler 
|book = 5 | spoiler =  When Lucia seizes a village on the [[Sixth Floor]] Hunting Grounds, Gustavo attacks a [[dryad]], which ends with Lucia and the dogs slaying all dryads in [[Diwata]]'s temple before challenging [[Donut]] to a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donut ultimately kills Cici (with style) before escaping, and Lucia responds by wailing, "She killed the wrong one."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, [[Florin]] insists that Gustavo 3 is remotely controlling Lucia.}}

      <text bytes="18582" sha1="prxvtimbas1m3rn9mfytabslemfuugn" xml:space="preserve">{{DISPLAYTITLE:HUD &amp; Crawler Menus}}

Immediately upon descending the stairwell to the [[First Floor|first floor]], all crawlers are equipped with a simple heads-up display (HUD) visual interface.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  The HUD's functions are limited until the crawler visits a [[Tutorial Guild Hall]] on one of the first three floors and completes the [[Tutorial|tutorial training]], which gives the crawler access to the expanded HUD and Crawler Menus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;     

The HUD is always active when the crawler is in the Dungeon unless the Crawler is in the presence of a Dungeon administrator.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 36).&lt;/ref&gt;  In this particular season of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'', due to a shoestring budget, crawlers have access to their HUD and menus as long as they are located between the Earth's core and sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various elements of the HUD can be upgraded by items, awards, potions, etc. 

== Before the Tutorial==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Error. You may not access this until you have completed the tutorial.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;After entering the surface stairwells and before entering the Dungeon, crawlers have access to a basic HUD.   A '''countdown timer''' to level collapse appears in the upper right corner of the crawler's vision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Additional functions include:

*The crawler can view and mentally "x" out of tool tips, including descriptions of other crawlers, mobs, and points of interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*After a mob takes damage, a health bar appears above its head.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The crawler can view achievements and notifications when they happen.  When in combat, new achievement and other notifications appear as little messages in the upper left of a crawler's vision. Otherwise, the messages auto-play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Languages are translated to Syndicate Standard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
*The AI's announcements are accompanied by text which cannot be dismissed, like subtitles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==HUD==
The HUD is always active in the crawler's vision, and can be customized by focusing on an item.  The basic HUD unlocked during the tutorial consists of (in clockwise order from the upper left):

# Notifications - upper left.
#Health Bar - top right.
#Mana Bar - top right, below health bar.
# Countdown Timer (changes location during tutorial) - top right, below mana bar.
#Minimap - bottom right.
#Hotlist - bottom center.

===&lt;u&gt;Notifications&lt;/u&gt;===
Notifications are sorted into a folder at the top left of the crawler's vision.  The folder blinks when there are unopened notifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These include:

*''Crawler Notifications'', seen only by the crawler.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These include: "You've gained a skill level!" and "Level up! You are now level -."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*''System Messages'', seen by everyone regardless of which floor they are on, and may be in different voices (such as [[Cascadia]]'s introductory announcements).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*''Floor-Specific Notifications''

===&lt;u&gt;Health Bar&lt;/u&gt;===
The Health Bar appears as a long green bar in the top right, just above the Countdown Timer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It represents the crawler's overall HP, and turns red when a crawler's health is low.  

The Health Menu (see below) breaks down the crawler's status in more detail.

===&lt;u&gt;Mana Bar&lt;/u&gt;===
The Mana Bar shows the crawler's remaining mana points (see "Magic Menu" section below), represented as a status bar of an unspecified color.  It appears in the top right, below the Health Bar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===&lt;u&gt;Countdown Timer&lt;/u&gt;===
The Countdown Timer to level collapse is still in the upper right, but now below the Health and Mana Bars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;The Minimap&lt;/u&gt;===
The minimap appears in the bottom right of the crawler's vision.  Focusing on the map enlarges it; it can be expanded to fill the crawler's entire vision.  

The basic minimap is a simple blue and gray map which represents nearby creatures as dots, and shows the cardinal directions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The map only shows areas the crawler has seen; the rest of the minimap is grayed out by the "'''fog of war'''," which obscures mobs, stairwells, and most locations.  Safe rooms are always visible, even when located inside the fog of war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

Slain bosses drop [[Neighborhood Map|area maps]] that remove the fog of war from the boss's location; e.g. a neighbor boss drops a neighborhood map, which allows the crawler to view the boss's entire neighborhood on their minimap, regardless of whether they have visited every location or not.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=== &lt;u&gt;Hotlist&lt;/u&gt; ===
Centered in the bottom of the Crawler's vision, the Hotlist has ten spots that can hold potions, spells, or special items.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Items such as potions can stack up to (999) per slot.  Taking a potion directly from the Hotlist uses the item and applies the effect automatically without requiring the crawler to physically drink it.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crawler Menu ==
'''You have been granted access to the Crawler Menu.'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the Crawler Menu is unlocked in the [[Tutorial|tutorial]], it functions similarly to Inventory and Character tabs in video games.  It includes the following (in alphabetical order):

#Crafting Menu
#Health Menu
#Inventory
# Magic Menu
#Messaging Menu
# Party Menu
#Pet Menu
#Player Stats
#Ratings Menu
#Skills Menu

===&lt;u&gt;'''Crafting Menu'''&lt;/u&gt;===
The Crafting Menu contains recipes for potions, items, and more.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 12).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not introduced during the tutorial.

===&lt;u&gt;'''Health Menu'''&lt;/u&gt;===
While the HUD Health Bar is a single green bar, the Health Menu is a more extensive pie chart and indicates any active conditions or debuffs. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Crawler is able to drill down and see which areas are affected, as well as detailed explanations of injuries and the healing process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the Dungeon, healing is accelerated.  Health slowly refills based on constitution level, and instantly refills when the crawler enters a stairwell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Dungeon automatically triages injuries and heals the most serious injuries first, but the Crawler can manually adjust the priority list.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

Spells such as [[Heal]], [[Heal Critter]], and [[Heal Party]], and items such as the [[Healing Potion|standard healing potion]] can be used to recover health more quickly.

===&lt;u&gt;'''Inventory'''&lt;/u&gt;===
In this season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', crawlers have "a dimensional inventory and AI cataloging system"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; -- essentially, unlimited inventory capacity and Achievements can unlock new filters/sorting options.  Items are added to Inventory using an '''Add to Inventory''' button.  

Inventory restrictions include:

*Any item the crawler can physically lift off the ground for ~4 seconds can be added to their inventory.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*If a living creature is added to inventory, it will immediately die.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Potions and similar items can be stacked up to 999 per slot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Inventory is time-locked, so food items will not expire&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and explosives will freeze.
*Gear and clothing can be transferred directly into the crawler's inventory, but the crawler has to physically put the gear on to equip it.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 25).&lt;/ref&gt;  (Quadrupeds have a different interface, which allows them to equip items and perform actions like opening doors directly from the menu.)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
The basic inventory is sorted into tabs and can be organized by value (although no actual gold value is shown to the crawler).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 24).&lt;/ref&gt;  Unopened [[:Category:Loot Boxes|Loot Boxes]] appear in the "Awards and Boxes" tab marked as '''Ready to Open'''.   New tabs/submenus appear as items are added, including such tabs as: Healing,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Food Items,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Gross Shit,&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 22).&lt;/ref&gt; History,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceuticals,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Potions,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and Quest Clues.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 18).&lt;/ref&gt;  

===&lt;u&gt;'''Magic Menu'''&lt;/u&gt; ===
The only real description of the Magic Menu is Carl's description: "complicated as shit."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Learned spells can be added to the hotlist.

At Level 1, '''mana points''' appear to be equal to the crawler's Intelligence stat and refill at a rate of approximately one point per hour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==='''&lt;u&gt;Messaging Menu&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
The Messaging Menu is not introduced during the tutorial (which presents "group chat" as exclusive to the Party Menu), but allows crawlers to start chats with crawlers and NPCs outside of their party.   Except in special circumstances, crawlers who do not share a Party must physically shake hands or fist-bump to communicate by chat.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Dungeon opens, viewers cannot see private chats between crawlers but [[Borant Corporation]] and the system AI can.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 40).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chats with Admins ====
After crawlers are entered into the [[Crawler Assisted Outreach Program]] and assigned a PR agent, the PR agent can create a special chat in the Messaging Menu.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 36).&lt;/ref&gt;  The admin has the ability to close the chat at any time; the chat disappears from the crawler's log, and the crawler cannot respond or open a new chat with the admin.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 41).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Chats with NPCs ====
[[Manager Benefit|Managers]] have private, protected chats with their crawlers, which are not accessible to viewers.  Sentient NPCs, including those currently employed in clubs such as the Desperado Club, can also communicate by chat. 

==== Quest Chats ====
All crawlers engaged in a group quest are lumped into a Quest Chat, which - similar to Discord - lists all participants on one side of the screen.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The party designated to host the group chat has the ability to remove or silence users from the chat.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (epilogue).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scratchpad ====
The Messaging Menu contains a '''scratchpad''', which a crawler can copy and paste items onto or simply record thoughts in.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;  

===&lt;u&gt;'''Party Menu'''&lt;/u&gt;===
New Crawlers are automatically grouped into a "party" with anyone who entered the Dungeon at the same time and place as them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Party Menu allows crawlers in groups to manage their party and use a group chat,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  as well as view each other's Stat, Health, Skills, and equipped items.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt; The party member with the highest combined stat total is designated as party leader and given more control over the party menu.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  

Crawlers in the same party share experience (EXP).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Crawlers in a party receive 9.8 EXP from consuming a 10-EXP crawler cookie, regardless of whether their party includes two or more members, so it appears that 2% of a crawler's earned experience is distributed equally across other party members.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 19).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a crawler first begins to use the group chat, a virtual keyboard materializes in front of them; however, most crawlers soon learn that they can simply focus on the chat window and think the words they want to send.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 15).&lt;/ref&gt;  If two party members are split up, and one is locked into a boss battle, they cannot use the Party Chat to communicate with each other until after the battle is over.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 22).&lt;/ref&gt;  
==='''&lt;u&gt;Pet Menu&lt;/u&gt;'''===
The Pet Menu is unlocked after the crawler tames a pet, and its dot turns orange.  The crawler can change the pet's name and title,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and view the pet's stats and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==='''&lt;u&gt;Player Stats&lt;/u&gt;'''===
The Player Stats menu allows Crawlers to view their current stats: 

*Strength:
*Intelligence:
*Constitution:
*Dexterity:
*Charisma:

The typical adult human averages between 3 and 5 in each of these stats when they enter the Dungeon, but may score outside of this range.  Crawlers will receive (3) stat points every time they level up, but cannot distribute these stat points until they choose a race and class on the [[Third Floor|third floor]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Items, gear, potions, and buffs may temporarily or permanently adjust these stats.

Wisdom is hidden and allegedly cannot be adjusted, as doing so impacts a person's personality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

==='''&lt;u&gt;Ratings&lt;/u&gt;'''===
The [[First Floor|first floor]] of the Dungeon is not accessible by live viewers, but crawlers who appear on the highlight reels will typically gain billions of views and millions of followers as soon as they reach the [[Second Floor|second floor]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Ratings Menu shows:

{| class="fandom-table"
|+&lt;small&gt;The Ratings Menu&lt;/small&gt;
!Stat
!Description
|-
|'''Views:'''
|Any time someone watches a crawler's feed for approximately 8 seconds counts as 1 view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|-
|'''Followers:'''
|Number of viewers who bookmarked the crawler's ID and can tune in when they want (unless the crawler is in the bathroom).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|-
|'''Favorites:'''
|Favoriting a crawler gives the viewer live updates on the crawler's stats and conditions, and if the crawler is in combat. Viewers receive a limited number of favorites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|-
|'''Patrons:'''
|Usually organizations, patrons sponsor popular crawlers for advertising purposes.  Patrons typically only send [[Loot Boxes|Silver or Gold Boxes]] due to the cost, but are exclusively able to send [[Sponsorship Box|Benefactor/Sponsor Boxes]], which contain the rarest items.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|}

=== '''&lt;u&gt;Skills Menu&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
The Skills Menu includes an infinite list of skills, both useful and useless, organized in pages.  If a crawler doesn't have a given skill, it appears "blurred out" and illegible on the list.  The list can be filtered by whether or not the crawler has the skill, the skill level, and more, by checking and unchecking boxes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The menu includes a search box.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Skills can be taught or trained in guildhalls scattered throughout the dungeon, or by equipment, potions (such as [[Legendary Skill Potion|Legendary Skill Potions]]), or spells.  It is relatively easy to train most skills to level 10 or 11, but the more advanced levels are a slog to train.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Most skills cap out at level 15.  The crawler's race or class can unlock the ability to train certain skills up to level 20.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Guildhalls throughout the Dungeon can teach crawlers how to use and train their skills.  Check the [[:Category:Skills|Skills Category]] page for some useful skills, or [[Carl]]'s profile for some examples of useless or joke skills (such as Dumpster Diving). 

== Additional Interface Tabs ==
Crawlers unlock new tabs in their interface over the course of the Dungeon.

=== '''&lt;u&gt;Quests&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
The Quest tab is unlocked when the crawler stumbles into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''&lt;u&gt;Sponsorship Tab&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
Unlocked after sponsorship bidding concludes on the fourth floor.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 11).&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== '''&lt;u&gt;Third-Party Upgrades&lt;/u&gt;''' ===
Unlocked by installing upgrades created outside the dungeon, such as a [[Valtay|Valtay Corporation]] Neural Enhancer.  Upgrades recorded in this tab do not include much information aside from the status, such as "This upgrade is working properly."&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 13).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Warning: All communication-based upgrades will be disabled while you are within the dungeon. Any attempts to circumvent dungeon security will result in immediate disqualification.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook.'' (p. 203). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
You have completed a quest, but you completed it in a way unusual enough to trigger the Hadji Achievement! And like the oft exploited street children of Kolkata, where there's one, there's usually more. This is one of the rare achievements that can be rewarded more than once. 

''Reward:'' Your Gold Quest box has been upgraded to a Platinum [[Quest Box]]!

Once an attraction at [[Grimaldi's Traveling Circus]] on the third floor, Heather the Bear was transformed into a monstrous [[Boss|Neighborhood Boss]] by [[Scolopendra]]'s curse.   [[Tsarina Signet]] of ''[[Vengeance of the Daughter|The Vengeance of the Daughter]]'' sacrificed countless victims to Heather over the years before asking [[Carl]] to kill Heather, claiming Heather's blood will be some of the most potent blood she's used for her summons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Admin Notice==
'''Admin Note: Boss Battles that arise concurrently with secondary productions or as parts of a Quest may present themselves differently. You will still receive awards commensurate with the boss’s proper rank. If you survive, of course.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 103; chapter 8). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==AI Description==
'''Level 19 Neighborhood Boss!''' 

'''Performing since she was a cub, Heather the Roller-Skating Bear was one of the longest-running attractions at Grimaldi’s Traveling Circus. Her retirement had been only weeks away when the cataclysm hit. Now the tired, old bear has been transformed into a monstrosity, barely recognizable from her former self. She lives out her days as a hunter for the circus, seeking out juicy mobs and unsuspecting crawlers. She finds and incapacitates her prey using her overwhelming speed and strength. Then she drags her quarry back to the circus so the clowns may feed.''' 

'''Somewhere in there, deep, deep down, there is a spark of the old Heather. The beloved bear has moments of lucidity as she runs down her terrified prey. In those brief moments, she thinks: ''Good. I’ve always hated all you assholes, anyway.'''''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (pp. 104-105; chapter 9). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
An exceptionally large former-black bear, Heather's skinless face is nothing but exposed skull and round red eyes, fused to a tattered pink clown hat that sits cockeyed on her skull and a pleated clown ruff around her neck.  Her two front paws have been replaced by dozens undulating white worms, which glow and extend.  She wears a pink tutu on her waist and well-oiled roller skates on her two back feet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When the worms come in contact with prey, they begin to burrow into flesh and immediately begin talking in their prey's mind.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl ultimately defeats Heather by healing her with [[Fireball or Custard?|a Fireball or Custard? scratch-off ticket]].  The custard kills the worms and restores her to a mostly-normal female black bear (which, according to Mordecai's not-so-helpful advice, is smarter than a male black bear).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Race: Amazonian Class: Shieldmaiden'''

Hekla is from Iceland. She is the party leader of Brynhild's Daughters. She is described as a pretty blonde. After taking the Amazonian race, she became taller and wider, with a bodybuilders physique. She wears an enchanted breastplate and wields a magical crossbow called the [[Enchanted Repeating Crossbow of the Scavenger Mother of Mothers]].  

Hekla was fighting with her husband when the dungeon was formed. Shortly afterwards, he was poisoned by a Walking Cactus and she fled. When she returned, he was being eaten by rats. She gained an achievement for killing one of them with a bone from her husband and was awarded a loot box containing an enchanted crossbow.  

During book 2, [[Carl]] appeared with Hekla on a show and she requested that he take in [[Katia Grim|Katia]], a party member she'd been separated from. 

{{Spoiler

In the Iron Tangle on floor four, Hekla met up with Donut, Carl, and Katia. She asked them to go to station 101 to aid a large group of stuck crawlers. With Hekla and the Daughters, they battled ghouls while riding to the station. Katia formed into a cowcatcher so they could roll through the ghouls. Taking advantage of the chaos and a distracted Katia, Hekla covertly attacked and wounded her with invisible arrows. However, Donut’s glasses allowed her to detect and call out Hekla's treachery, prompting her to confess that she ordered their healer [[Silfa]] not to aid Katia. She was planning to lure Carl into attacking Silfa, giving her an excuse to kill him and recruit Princess Donut and her manager [[Mordecai]] to [[Brynhild's Daughters]]. Katia awoke confused as accusations were flying. She fought with her friend Eva and used the [[Rush]] ability, intending to kill her. Thrown off kilter, she instead lethally hit Hekla and took the [[Enchanted Repeating Crossbow of the Scavenger Mother of Mothers|magical crossbow]] from her corpse. }}

==Description==
She was the author of the 16th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
During my studies, I have run across multiple castle variations. So far I have identified three distinct types. The size of the castle doesn't seem to have a bearing on what type it is. It is more a function of the game's insistence to forward the narrative, not unlike how the musical key of a Virilean opera movement is a function of the performer's ability to progress and not necessarily in service to aural aesthetics. The first iteration is just a regular building like anything else you might encounter in the dungeon. It is a fortified building with monsters, sometimes with a boss within. Sometimes a quest is involved, but the castle is usually an obstacle or part of the environment, not the target of the quest. I have found this type to be the most common. The second type is a governmental entity. Usually, this is a quest target. One must either claim the throne room or kill a boss. Once this occurs, the castle is "conquered" and whatever this castle has dominion over is obtained. It can be a region or a whole country or just the castle itself or simply a quest trigger. Once this goal is met, the castle itself is no longer relevant. (Incidentally, this second iteration is the type in [[Ninth Floor|the faction wars]] games of the ninth floor. There, each team is gifted with a throne seed the moment we crawlers arrive. They are given a day to place the seed, and the game begins. The seed must be placed within a self-contained structure on their property. Oftentimes they have prepared for this by pre-building a castle or using a pre-existing structure. The location of this building cannot be hidden, so placing the seed within a fortified structure is the best choice. Once the castle is conquered, then the associated armies are defeated and dominion is transferred to the conqueror.) (See my essay on the nature of NPCs for more insight on how conquering areas may be utilized to forward my Worn Path Method of enlightenment.) The third castle type is similar to the second with a small difference. The castle itself is a self-contained village with an NPC and guard ecology. It is almost identical to the villages and cities of the third and sixth floor. If conquered, the castle will appear in the crawler's interface as an owned village and taxes will be collected. Guards can be controlled just as if in a regular village. I have not personally administered a castle, but a fellow crawler has. They state there are a few differences to the interface regarding town defense and available upgrades, but they have not told me what they are and threatened to punch me in the mouth if I kept asking, so I have refrained. If I learn more, I will update this entry. (Chapter 54, Book 5)

Show them the lie. Show them the seams. Shows them the path they're on is a false one. Think of a trolley on a track. A worn path is easily traveled. The more worn the path, the more difficult it is to get them to look away. Just like the deeper the track, the sturdier the trolley.. But even the strongest of minds, even those controlled and relentlessly corrected can be derailed just as a trolley can be derailed by a tiny, properly placed pebble. Find the pebble and place it on the path, and their own momentum will do the work for you. (Chapter 56, Book 5)

I do wonder, sometimes, how my worn path method will work on the deeper floors with the longer timelines. Tea that steeps too long tends to take on an unexpected flavor. (Chapter 21, Book 6)

[[Milk]] is correct here about the stairwells. It states in the rules manual that while stairwells may be gated until certain conditions are met, the stairwells themselves are not allowed to be removed from the playing field. (Chapter 61, Book 6)

I'm starting to believe I have the ability to manifest my own destiny, after a certain fashion. The more unstable the AI running this system becomes, the less predictable it is. Yet at the same time, it's even more predictable in certain ways. I made a quip about being hungry, and I suddenly received a random achievement notification about my hunger level. I discussed with my friend how I wished we could kill more ghasts, because they often drop knowledge scrolls, and not one hour later, I received a quest to hunt down a certain number of the very same monsters. Beware, however. That same quest killed my friend. The AI is always listening, thinking, plotting, changing the game to suit its desires. At the higher levels, it is not as rigid as it once was. That pliability can be an asset or an extreme danger. (Chapter 62, Book 6)

Hole is a utility spell that makes a hole in a surface. Obtained by [[Donut]] on [[Fourth Floor|Floor 4]] through her membership to the [[Dungeon Book of the Floor Club]].
==Description==
'''Cost''': Unknown amount of mp per second (Donut can use it continuously for about 5 minutes near the beginning of floor 4)

'''Target''': Any surface within spell radius

'''Duration''': Variable, can be canceled at will

Allows the caster to instantly carve a cylindrical volume, a hole, out of a surface of their choosing. The diameter of the hole by default is about the size of a manhole cover, but it can be changed with practice. The depth of the hole scales at 3cm per spell level. At level 1 it creates more of a dimple in most surfaces rather than a hole. When the spell ends the hole disappears, leaving the affected area undamaged.

Anything that can fit in the hole created by the spell can pass through it, but the spell can also be used offensively to create portal cuts.  When the spell ends it destroys any matter that's occupying the space created by the spell.

== AI Description ==
You have discovered a reward room! Scattered throughout the dungeon, reward rooms offer crawlers items generally not available within loot boxes. Most reward rooms only allow one choice. So, if you're in a party of multiple people, tell them I said ''you'' should get the prize, not them.

'''Reward:''' Don't be a greedy bitch. The goddammed room is the reward.

[[Carl]] teleported to Zockau to get a pre-emptive attack on the hunters in [[Sixth Floor|The Hunting Grounds]].

==Description==
You teleported to a stairwell station within the first thirty hours of the floor being open. What, you're running away early? I hope for your sake you don't actually go down the stairs. You know it doesn't get easier.

{{Character_info|species=Human {{!}} [[Bush Elf]]|first_appearance=Chapter 1, Book 5|level=30}}
Ian - Bush Elf. Level 30. Registration Area Attendant. This is a Non-Combatant NPC.

You know those perpetually-depressed emo kids from high school who always sat on the floor during lunch? If they participated in extracurricular activities, it was always either drama, yearbook committee, or the dreaded anime club. They planned on changing the world with some bullshit cause. They all had jobs at the smoothie place. Then after high school, they just kinda got absorbed by the world, like  pouring a dark drink into a rushing stream. You blinked, and they were just gone, along with all of their black hair dye and all of their dreams.

That is a Bush Elf. A once-proud people, almost physically indistinguishable from the ruling class High Elves, Bush Elves are the regular joes of the forest. If you look really close, you can see the wrinkles around their eyes, or the very slight hunch to their backs. A sign of their defeat. They tend to favor druid magic and jobs at places where they're in cubicles.

Sometimes they remember how strong of a people they once were.

== Description ==
Ian is a former human crawler who is usually an attendant at Club Vanquisher. His brother was killed by [[Vrah]] in the previous season.

'''Race:''' Human       '''Class:''' Physicker (Healer)

Ifechi entered [[Dungeon|The Dungeon]] with a large group of men, unarmed and carrying a medical bag, it's later revealed that she used to be a member of the red cross. In Chapter 31, the group goes from 150 to about 80 due to infighting. The entire group, minus Ifechi, is killed fighting a City Boss slime monster. Ifechi survived by being outside the boss room when it sealed.

It is revealed in Book 4 that Ifechi is a woman and Florin's girlfriend. She is killed when [[Lucia Mar]] casts ''Rubber'' on herself and [[Florin|Florin's]] shotgun blasts are reflected to his partner's head.

Her twin sister is resurrected as [[Imogen|Queen Imogen]] for [[The Butcher's Masquerade]].

== Gear ==
She had a staff that summons hundreds of leaches, once they cover a mob they can kill it in seconds. Afterwards the leaches are filled with blood and other fluids from their victims and if eaten they make whoever eat them stronger.

==Description==
Author of the 11th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
We are meant to live solitary lives, even the eunuchs amongst us. Still, the sight of him, twisted and changed, speaking with that same voice that once said such sweet words... It broke me, friends. It broke me in such a way I did not think possible after all that has happened. They're not the same. Even if cured of the rot injected into their aura. Don't even try. Hope is crucial, but it can also be poison if it is blind. (Chapter 52, Book 5)

My people have a saying. "The burning [[Yenk]] needs only to embrace their enemies." It likely translates poorly, but what it means is that some problems aren't problems at all if you think on it long enough. (Chapter 52, Book 6)

Gods, I am so lonely. (Chapter 63, Book 6)

==AI Description ==
'''Queen Imogen - High Elf Cleric Sorceress. Level 145 Country Boss'''

This isn't just any high elf. This is Imogen, the queen of the elves. The big baddie of the floor. Don't let her good looks and polite manner fool you. She is as ugly as they come.

Sometimes, when we meet bad guys, there's a lingering possibility that we might see some sort of redemption arc. There's a good quality buried in there somewhere. Did you know, for example, that Juicer guy you murdered on the first floor used to spend all his free time volunteering at a hedgehog rescue? Remember Denise the goose? The one you shoved headfirst into the garbage disposal? She loved reading to children. In fact, you've now killed two bosses who loved reading to kids.

Anyway, Imogen doesn't have any qualities like that. Not a one. She has never left a tip in her life. If they had shopping carts in this world, she'd never return it to the receptacle. Sure, she pretends to be a kind and just leader. She throws a killer party, that's for certain.

But in the end, it's all a show. Everything she does is in service of her main motivation, which is power. She's nothing more than a terrified little girl, afraid of weakness, afraid of dying like her father, King Finian. Impotent and alone and overshadowed by someone more powerful.

She has a plan to make certain that never happens to her. A plan that all hinges on the success of tonight's masquerade.

I sure hope you don't do anything to piss her off. That might be bad.

The '''Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act''' is a [[Syndicate]] law.

Subsection 35, in conjunction with the [[Mined Material Reclamation Act]], requires that survivors of the [[The Transformation|Transformation]] must be given the opportunity to reclaim the matter lost in the event.  The "assigned planetary regent" may "choose the manner of this reclamation."  Option 3 is the [[Dungeon|18-Level World Dungeon]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Dungeon Crawler Carl'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Another option is presumably the battle royale aired in other seasons. 

The law also requires that all remaining matter must be repurposed to create the subterranean World Dungeon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== AI Description ==
'''Jikininki. Level 17.'''

Of all the types of ghouls one may find in the [[Fourth Floor|Iron Tangle Rail System]], the Jikininki is the most common, the most well-behaved, and the most insatiable. Their voracious appetite for flesh makes them the perfect janitors. They'll generally leave you alone as long as you're not bleeding, as long as you don't litter, and as long as you don't trespass into their personal space. It's rude.

==Description==
Not only have you been given a quest, but you actually completed it without dying. We like it when you do what you're told. It means you're a good dungeon citizen and not a traitor to your people at all. 

''Reward:'' In addition to the Gold [[Quest Box]] you've received for completing the quest, new quest locations will ''sometimes'' appear on your map. Notice how I italicized "sometimes"? The next one was even more interesting.

'''Justice Light''' is a [[Skyfowl | Skyfowl of the White Cliffs]], former crawler, and author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]]'' (8th Edition).

==Cookbook Entries==
&lt;Note by Crawler Justice Light, 8th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I made a mistake today. I killed an NPC I shouldn’t have. We are a strong people, the skyfowl of the white cliffs. We do not take insults without retribution. He was a proprietor of a store selling trap supplies in a large settlement here on the sixth floor. I needed what he had, but he insulted me, so I killed him. It let me take the item that was on the shelf. But he had so much more. He always said the items were in the back, but there was nothing there. I think everything was in his inventory, but it appears shopkeepers don’t drop their full inventory if you kill them. Now the town guards are after me, and the shop, which was a good source of supplies for me and many others, is just gone, and I fear the whole operation is going to fail thanks to my actions. It was the only trap shop on the whole floor.''

Killing of these innocents should be kept to a minimum, unless absolutely necessary.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (p. 490). Dandy House.

== Description ==
This is a minion of Lusca.

Ah, the babies. Here’s the thing about Octo-Shark babies. The odds are stacked against them from the get-go. There’s just too many of them. Their mom is really strict and won’t let them leave her mouth. They don’t know who their daddies are, which makes them kinda sad, especially around Christmas. They need constant nourishment. So when food does arrive, they have to fight for their morsels. Only the strongest survive.

Eventually, even Lusca won’t be able to keep up with the demand. That’s right around the time the juveniles start to realize their brothers and sisters are also delicious. In each birthing of 2-3,000 pups, only one or two survive.

In other words, their odds of survival are better than yours!

Katia Grim joins [[Carl]] and [[Donut]]'s party on the [[Third Floor]].

==Description==
Katia was a university art professor in Reykjavik, Iceland, before the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A single thirty-something, Katia is well-traveled and fluent in Icelandic, German, Russian, and English.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|2|epi}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

She enters the [[Dungeon]] with her friend and fellow professor, [[Eva Sigrid|Eva]].   The two join [[Hekla]] and [[Brynhild's Daughters]] and participate in a neighborhood boss and a borough boss battle before descending to the [[Third Floor]], where they are separated from the party for [[class]] selection.  After her game guide, Bannon, persuades her to take the [[Monster Truck Driver]] class and [[Doppelgänger]] race, Katia transforms into a tank with a momentum-based constitution buff who can shape her mass (i.e. body and equipped gear) like clay into any form of equal mass... if she can just figure out how. By the time Hekla asks the Royal Court to add Katia to their party, Katia is ten levels behind and the [[System AI]] has only recently graduated her visible race from "What the f-word?" to "Human."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|2|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Carl and Donut's influence, Katia soon learns to use her skills to kill with style.  

{{Spoiler
| book = 4, 5, 6
| spoiler = &lt;p&gt;When Carl and Donut are removed from the fifth floor, Katia assumes leadership of the ongoing bubble quest and succeeds.  Enraged to learn that members of Brynhild's Daughters are returning to Eva and dying, she informally splits from the Royal Court on the [[Sixth Floor]] to team up with [[Louis]], [[Firas]], [[Daniel Bautista]], [[Florin]], and [[Gwendolyn Duet|Gwen's]] team. They follow a trail of Eva's victims across The Hunting Grounds and Katia finds the "gift" Eva left for her on one of the former daughter's corpses: [[Blitz Sticks | blitz sticks]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katia and Bautista had been in contact since meeting on the second floor and develop a romantic/sexual relationship on the sixth floor, even as Katia becomes addicted to drugs and the false memories they create. Katia's self-destructive habits worsen after she kills Eva, and Eva's last act is placing the [[Enchanted Crown of the Sepsis Whore]] upon Katia's head, ensuring that only Katia '''or''' Donut can leave the [[Ninth Floor]] by traditional means.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

==Appearance==
[[File:00798x.jpg|thumb|Katia on floor 3 unable to pass for human (AI Gen)]]
'''On Earth, While Sleeping, and On Shows.'''  In her natural human form, Katia has short black hair, pale skin, and "light wide-set eyes that sat at an odd angle on her face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Although Carl describes her as "stunning," she hadn't liked her hair or her nose; they were the first traits she changed.

'''The Third Floor.'''   Katia struggled to master her race, sculpting her appearance using the reflection off of a [[Healing Potion|health potion]] bottle, and it shows.  Her face generously looks "like a Juan Gris painting" (a twentieth century artist known for cubism), her hair follicles are too large, and even her blue track suit and snow boots look poorly sewn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   

'''The [[Fourth Floor]].'''  With Donut's encouragement, Katia slowly transforms to become more "vibrant" and "interesting."  Her new look is marked by a purple mohawk, a leather outfit, and black shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 15).&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = '''The [[Eighth Floor]].''' Katia stops reshaping the four fingers that were severed from her right hand during the Iron Tangle.
}}

==Personality==
[[File:00799.jpg|thumb|Katia looking less grim on the 8th floor (AI Gen)]]
Insecure, shy, and a little awkward, Katia is initially afraid of almost everything in the Dungeon and struggles to understand her class and race.   Still, she is a fundamentally good person: when [[Fools Who Broke the Glass|The Fools Who Broke the Glass]] triggers shortly after she joins the Royal Court, spelling her near-certain death, she focuses on saving NPCs and encourages Donut and Carl to save themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario,'' chapter 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  She has a quiet sense of humor and is clearly not a person who is used to or comfortable with being noticed.  

With Donut's "advice" and Carl's very special brand of support, Katia starts to come into her own.  

==History==
[[File:00795.jpg|thumb|Katia as a human (AI Gen)]]
On Earth, Katia has previously visited at least Moscow and Tokyo.  Although Katia claims that she and Eva were "friends but not great friends" who ate lunch together occasionally at the university, Eva knows a great deal about her including: Katia's ex, Fannar, left Katia for one of his students; that Katia was unable to adopt; and Katia's enough of Katia's secrets to taunt her.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|epi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spoiler
| book = 5 and 6
| spoiler = Katia had wanted to start a family but was unable to conceive and prevented from adopting. Before the Butchering, when she smokes [[Blitz Sticks]], she thinks of Annie: the nine month old girl she had wanted to adopt. She remembers Annie standing in her crib, and she remembers picking the baby up in her arms. For an unspecified but probably terrible reason, this memory is paired with two quotes:

* ''I do that sometimes. I hurt those around me.'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Butcher's Masquerade'' (p. 717; epilogue). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Why do you do this,'' Fannar used to say. ''You’re dumb. Dumber than you look. Do you really think I’d start a family with you? You’re a joke. Do you really think you could be a mother? Do you really think I’d let you do more damage to this world?'' &lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

A relatively new addition to ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'', the kinder facility is a structure on the planet's surface that is staffed by [[Youth Assistant|youth assistants]].  Pregnant women and crawlers below a certain age (determined each season based on the species and intelligence level) who descend the stairs after the transformation and attempt to enter the dungeon are instead transported to the kinder facility, where they will remain until the crawl ends. &lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt.

This season, the facility is managed by [[Borant Corporation|Borant]] and located in the former city of Mumbai, India.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt.

Kiwi is a female Velociraptor first lives in the [[Sixth Floor|Hunting Grounds]].

She and [[Mongo]] slept together it's later implied she became pregnant.

She is the mother of [[Big Tina]].

She was actually an [[Ursine]] but was transformed into a dinosaur after [[Scolopendra|Scolopendra's]] attack, she managed to returned to her original form during the [[Sixth Floor | Butcher's Masquerade]] thanks to the [[I Take It All Back Potion|I Take It All Back]] potion.

==Abilities==
[[Deer in the Headlights]] skill.

==AI Description==
'''Kiwi. Mongoliensis Pack Leader- Level 60.'''

They say an asteroid is what wiped out the dinosaurs on this planet.

I don't think that's true. If Kiwi and her pack of voracious, slightly-insane velociraptors are even remotely like what you had roaming around way back in the late Cretaceous period, I'm pretty sure what happened is that these ladies simply killed everyone and everything.

This is Kiwi. The head bitch in charge of the jungle's fastest, most vicious, most clever predators: the Mongoliensis. Take a gang of women convicts from a 1970's prison movie. Combine them with a coalition of cheetahs and a shoal of hungry piranhas, and you have a vague notion of just how screwed you are.

This particular pack if comprised of only females. In fact, it appears all the dinosaurs in the area are female. That's pretty odd. Almost interesting.

And here's an even more interesting, seemingly random, but probably important fact. Dinosaur-class monsters didn't exist in the area before [[Scolopendra|Scolopendra's]] nine-tier attack. Yet here they are. Where did they come from? If you weren't about to die screaming, it would be something you might want to look into.

Warning: This is a lizard-class mob. It will inflict 20% more damage against you thanks to your [[Extinction Sigil Tattoo (Wall Monitor Race)|Extinction Sigil]].

And yes, I know dinosaurs aren't really lizards if we're being super technical. Get over it.

== AI Description ==
'''Krakaren Clone. Level 10 Neighborhood Boss!'''

First off, this isn’t the Krakaren. This is a Krakaren. For every one that is killed, [[Krakaren Prime]] births two more.

Part of a collective mind intent upon destroying any semblance of scientific progress in the universe, the Krakaren is the only communal brain entity in the galaxy who actually gets stupider as time moves on. Consisting of multiple, shrieking tentacles, members of the Krakaren cooperative spend their days birthing their disease-laden minions, creating and selling harmful products, attempting to debate scientific experts, and proselytizing to the weak-minded, all in an attempt to… Well, nobody knows what the hell their end goal is.

Even [[Eris]], Goddess of Chaos, doesn’t want anything to do with these crazy assholes.

==Description==
'''Cost''': unknown

'''Target''': Someone wearing armor, line of sight

'''Duration''': unknown

Removes a random piece of armor from the target and causes it to fall on the floor. The effectiveness of the spell scales with level. Initially it can only target minor pieces of armor, but at level 5 it can target breastplates or the equivalent. At level 10, it can strip an opponent bare. At level 15, it can target multiple opponents.

Crawler Tin, of the 21st edition of the Cookbook, also theorizes that since the gods and goddesses are technically Soul Armor, any spell that targets biological armor, like Laundry Day, should in theory be able to remove a sponsor from the deity they are piloting as long as their invulnerability is first neutralized.

You have been hit with - and survived - an offensive spell that was higher that level 15. The fact you are not a quivering stain of meat on the dungeon floor right now is a testament to your sheet luck. It's either that or you're banging the producer.

'''Type''': Summoning Spell.

'''Cost''': 25 mana

'''Duration''': (spell level*2 + intelligence level) seconds.

'''Cooldown''': One minute. May only have one active instance of this spell at a time.

'''Target''': May only be cast on unattended armor or weapons. Total targets allowed varies based on multiple factors.

'''Effect''': There are a lot of angry souls out there. Like, a lot. It’s said if one has the ability to actually see all the wailing souls that filter through the edges of our world, one would go quite insane.

Quite, quite insane, actually. All that death, spiraling down, down, down into the drain. Where do they go? Why are they always screaming?

Uh, anyway. This spell reanimates physical weapons or armor pieces for a period of time with an undead, wailing spirit plucked straight from the river of falling souls. These will be temporary minions of the caster. Strength of the summoned symbiotes varies, depending on multiple factors.

'''Warning''': In most cases, armor and weapons utilized with this spell will disintegrate upon the completion of this spell. Certain cursed and enchanted items may react in an unpredictable manner upon the completion of the spell.

A master politician and stickler for rules, Leon might have been a tax attorney in another life. Now he lives as the chief political officer aboard the dreadnaught ''Wasteland''.

I'd say he has a stick up his ass, but he's always clenched so tight, there's no way a stick would fit up there.

Crawlers gain three (3) stat points each time they level up, but they cannot distribute these stat points until they choose a race and class on the [[Third Floor|third floor]].&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;  Abilities, items, and buffs (such as [[Enhanced Growth]]) may affect the number and distribution of stat points a crawler receives each level.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt.

'''Levi the Seventh - Troll Flesher and Hobgoblin Skellie Symbiote. Level 7.'''

This is actually two creatures. Only when combined do they have intelligence and the ability to speak. The Skellie is your typical, run-of-the-mill reanimated skeleton. In this case, it's the skeleton of a hobgoblin, one of the few monsters who are much more palatable in skeleton form.

Of all the War Mage spells soldiers encounter during the brutal, mass combat that will occur on the ninth floor, the ''You're Not Done Yet'' spell is one of the most terrifying. Fallen soldiers - in this example a Basher Troll - are cast with the spell, and their flesh is ripped from the body. This loose skin becomes a sentient minion called a Flesher. Fleshers are oftentimes tossed across the battlefield, landing in and around the trenches of the enemy. Fleshers have one goal. To find a new set of bones.

Once they have found a victim, the skin unfurls and pounces, covering the body, smothering and melting it. Once dead, the rest of the victim burns away, and the Flesher casts the only spell it knows. ''Boned'', which animates the remaining skeleton.

The creature that eventually forms is no longer a minion to the original mage. Not is it undead. It is new to the world, oftentimes confused and afraid. And weak. The Symbiote is very easy to kill. After a few hours have passed and the new Symbiote is complete, the combined creature becomes a target for other Fleshers, who are said to be drawn to their former companion's new bones. If a Flesher kills a Symbiote, this second iteration is more intelligent and powerful than the last.

There are rumors about oft-resleeved Symbiotes. After enough repetitions, it's whispered they can become quite powerful.

Here's a neat bit of trivia. This is Levi the 7th. This [[Levi is On the Menu!|quest]] has triggered six times now since the floor has opened.

'''Lexis''' is [[Odette]]'s assistant and an associate producer of ''[[Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Lexis is extremely matter-of-fact and efficient in the studio and in combat.  She is the first Syndicate Human that [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] meet, and she explains the tunnelling and recording process clearly and concisely. 

She smokes the same vape pens as Quasar; the smoke refracts light and smells like burnt candy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|5|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Appearance ==
Lexis is approximately 5' 5" (165.1cm) and willowy; as a Syndicate Human, she is only about 3/4 as wide as an Earth Human.  Appearing to be in her late 20s, she has Asian features and long blonde hair held back in a tight bun.  When her clothing is described, she's wearing a simple black dress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her voice is "light and musical. Almost cartoonish."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Story==
{{Spoiler
| book = 4
| spoiler = Armed with a flechette gun and a skintight black bodysuit with a translation module, Lexis locates [[Beatrice]] on Earth when Bea's bounty is the highest on the [[Walk-On List]].  In the process, Lexis kills [[Gennrik]], captures [[Sadir]], and -- efficient as ever -- suggests wiping out the entire settlement of [[New Queen Anne]] before Odette proposes a more humane option.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
}}

{{Spoiler
| book = 5
| spoiler = During the hand-off between [[Valtay]] and [[Borant Corporation]] on the [[Sixth Floor]], Lexis - at Odette's behest - warns Carl and Donut about the upcoming Butcher's Masquerade and country boss [[Imogen | Queen Imogen]]. She encourages them to go down the stairs early.  Donut reveals to both Carl and Lexis that she had helped smuggle Valtay agents to [[Zev]] shortly before Donut and Carl are teleported back to the [[Dungeon]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
}}

{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = The first time Carl sees Lexis after Donut's big reveal, Lexis and Zev are whispering to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lexis sits beside Carl while Odette explains her motivations for participating in the [[Twelfth Floor]] Ascendency Games, and her only reaction is a sharp breath when Odette states that she expects to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Speculation==
*Odette calls Lexis "Plexis" exactly one time during the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Is it a typo, or is it Lexis's full name?

While it's not exactly a feat of engineering worth of a Queen Elizabeth Prize, you finally managed to manufacture a train derailment.

== Book 6 ==
Long Haul Biological Waste Management Solutions is a front company for the [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)|Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network]]. In [[The Eye of the Bedlam Bride (Book)|book 6]] they sponsor [[Donut]] and send her a Celestial [[Benefactor Box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsorship starts shortly before all members of [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)|The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network]] disapear.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the Epilogue it is revealed that former [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|cookbook]] authors, [[Tipid]] and [[Rosetta]], are aboard a converted garbage freighter belonging to the company. This freighter, "Homecoming Queen", is used to smuggle 50,000 former crawlers into [[Ninth Floor|factions wars]] to aid [[Carl]] and [[Donut|Donut's]] [[Princess Posse (faction)|Princess Posse faction]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|Epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I always knew I would die in the dungeon. Even after I got out, I always knew." -- &lt;small&gt;[[Tipid]] (Book 6, Epilogue)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Porthus|Porthus aka Doctor Hu]], 2nd author of the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|cookbook]], is known to have recruited [[Tipid]] and [[Rosetta]] to [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)|The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network]] and therefore Long Haul Biological Waste Management Solutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fans &lt;br /&gt;
Sponsors|buy=Not Eligible|sell=Not Eligible}}

'''Loot Boxes''' are generally distributed to crawlers by the [[System AI]] as rewards for earning [[Achievements]].  The [[:Category:Loot Boxes|type of loot box]] a crawler receives is tailored to the achievement, and the semi-randomly generated loot is influenced by the box's type.  Special boxes may be ordered by the crawler's [[Fan Box|fans]] or [[Sponsorship Box|patrons]]. 

==Tiers==
There are six tiers of Loot Boxes.  A lower tier loot box will contain common or unenchanted items, whereas higher tier boxes contain more powerful and rare loot. The tiers are (in order of lowest to highest):&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

#Bronze
#Silver
#Gold
#Platinum
#Legendary
#Celestial

The host company pays taxes to the Syndicate on the tier of every non-sponsored box distributed in game.  As a result, only 2,145 Celestial Boxes of any kind have been awarded in the history of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]].''  No crawler has ever received more than four Celestial Boxes, and no more than (18) have been distributed during a single season.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|epi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Sponsorship Box|Benefactor/Sponsorship Boxes]] are purchased at great expense by a crawler's patrons/sponsors, with the cost increasing with the box's tier.  They often contain stronger equipment and items, and may include items from the sponsor's homeworld or other items or equipment that do not match the dungeon's match.  In general, a Bronze Benefactor box is better than a Gold Adventurer Box.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Loot==
Loot is "semi-random" in that it may be random or it may be specifically chosen to help or hurt the crawler for the sake of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crawler may also receive loot can be used by their race but not by their class; so a barbarian may end up with a necromancer's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All loot gained from Loot Boxes (with the exception of [[Sponsorship Box|Benefactor Boxes]]) will fit the [[Dungeon]]'s setting, so no one in [[Borant Corporation|Borant]]'s fantasy-themed dungeon will find "a pulse rifle or automated power armor" when opening one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Loot Boxes may contain unstable or damaged loot, but will never contain outright cursed loot; still, some items may be dangerous or harmful for the crawler.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Mordecai]] emphasizes, "Always read the descriptions before you activate or wear something. Always, always. No exceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (p. 52). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening Loot Boxes==
After completing the [[Tutorial]] in a [[Tutorial Guild Hall|Tutorial Guild]], crawlers can access unopened Loot Boxes through the "Awards and Boxes" tab of their Inventory [[HUD / Crawler Menu|Crawler Menu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unopened boxes cannot be sold or transferred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Loot Boxes can only be opened in Safe Rooms and most be opened all at once; the crawler cannot pick and choose boxes, or stop before all boxes are opened.  The boxes float out of the crawler's inventory and line up in front of the crawler by tier, from Bronze to Celestial, before opening one by one: the top pops open, the box disappears in a puff of smoke, and the items appear on the ground and then are automatically deposited into the Crawler's inventory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He repeatedly joked about how hot he thought [[Epitome Noflex]] was and asked [[Juice Box]] to turn into her so he could pretend to be have sex with her as a result the Dream faction in the [[Sixth Floor|Hunting Grounds]] planned to shoot him with an [[Arrow of Enthusiastic Double Gonorrhea]] as revenge.

Got engaged to [[Juice Box]] near the end of the [[The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book)|fifth book]].

He broke down after having to fight a copy of his mother on the eigth floor. Near the end of the level he got five player killer skull.

'''Lucia Mar''' is a young teenage girl from South America, and one of the Top Ten Crawlers on this season of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]''.

== Description ==
Lucia Mar enters the dungeon in Ecuador with her two rottweilers, [[Cici]] and [[Gustavo 3]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  The youngest crawler is a fan favorite, but dangerous and volatile both inside and outside of the [[Dungeon]]; her personality always rapidly switching from friendly to murderous. She specializes in traps, strong magic, and melee damage.

On the [[Third Floor]], Lucia takes the [[Lajabless]] race and the cleric/magic-user/warrior combo [[Black Inquisitor General]] class.  She now splits her day between two forms: a beautiful adult woman with half of her base strength, twice her magical ability, and the ability to cast spells for half the mana cost; and a skull-faced monster that must pay twice base cost to cast spells, but also has twice her base strength.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|2|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, all magic cast in her skeleton form comes from items.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ref|5|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
When Lucia enters the dungeon, she looks like an approximately 13 year-old street kid wearing an oversized yellow soccer jersey with a thick blue stripe.  A mere sixty hours later, she has a full set of glowing silver armor; she wears her jersey over the armor like a tabard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning on the [[Third Floor|third floor]], she spends half the day as a beautiful adult woman and the other half as "a skull-faced monstrosity."  In both forms, she now walks with a pronounced limp (which lessens over time), as her right leg has transformed into a hairy goat leg with a cloven hoof.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The transformation between the forms is instantaneous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Beginning on the fourth floor, she may or may not be wearing a necklace fashioned from monster tongues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

* As a beautiful woman, she has sparkling raven hair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In her "lady Skeletor" form, her skull eye sockets teem with bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Story: A Deep Dive ==
Lucia Mar enters the dungeon in Ecuador with her two rottweilers, [[Cici]] and [[Gustavo 3]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{ref|5|71}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She features heavily in the second episode of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' sixty hours later, which shows the young teenager already kitted out with a full set of enchanted armor and a mace.  Cici has equipped a chainmail sweater, and Gustavo 3 can shoot lightning when it barks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She and her dogs continue to steal the spotlight in recap episodes as they tear and smash their way through the first floor, showcasing an unspecified dexterity bonus that allows her to run on walls and do flips.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{ref|1|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Lucia soon proves that her aggression is not limited to dungeon mobs.  After her post-first floor interview on ''[[Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette]]'', during which one of her dogs mauled Odette's producer, [[Odette]] calls her a "psychopath" who "cannot work a crowd."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Thirty hours later, just over a day after the second floor opens, Lucia has accumulated four player killer skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point during the first and second floors, she kills her first [[Game Guide|game guide]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{ref|4|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Arriving on the [[Third Floor]] and at the top of the [[Leaderboard]], Lucia takes the [[Lajabless]] race and the cleric/magic-user/warrior combo [[Black Inquisitor General]] class.  Her new race causes her to limp as she walks with one human and one goat leg, and she now splits her day between two forms: a beautiful adult woman with half of her base strength, twice her magical ability, and the ability to cast spells for half the mana cost; and a skull-faced monster that must pay twice base cost to cast spells, but also has twice her base strength.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|2|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, all magic cast in her skeleton form comes from items.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ref|5|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She promptly displays her new abilities in the [[Desperado Club]], where she freezes everyone with a powerful spell, smashes an Elite's head with her mace, and steals a few bottles of tequila while her dogs (which had already killed two attendants and another pet in the playroom) attack the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she appears on ''[[Knuckle Cracking]]'', where she expresses that any moment not spent gaining experience is a waste of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler = &lt;p&gt;Still topping the leaderboard on the [[Fourth Floor]], Lucia Mar becomes more brutal in her skull-faced form; crafting necklaces from tongues and smashing a mantaur against a train repeatedly until it dies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{ref|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At some point in the middle of the floor, Cici transforms to become twice its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lucia and her dogs move to the stairwell for the final time, she has "a mess of boss kills and player-killer skulls over her head" and talks nonsense to phantoms (see "Speculation" below for specifics).  The recap episode shows her square off against [[Florin]], [[Ifechi]], and an unnamed crawler in the stairwell as Gustavo 3 blocks the way down; she casts [[Rubber]] three times, and all three of Florin's bullets strike and kill Ifechi instead of Lucia or her dogs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the [[Fifth Floor]] Bubbles, Lucia is shown working with a group of crawlers (including Bini, Abraham, and Siti) against a multi-limbed ice mummy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  [[Carl]] learns that Lucia has confessed in writing to killing two dungeon administrators in separate incidents, and the next recap episode shows Gustavo 3 "accidentally" killing the crawlers she was working with and the young girl break down sobbing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the video, she slams her hand against her temple in a steady rhythm: ''slap, slap, slap.''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}{{Spoiler 
| book = 5 | spoiler = &lt;p&gt;On the [[Sixth Floor]] Hunting Grounds, [[The Dark Hive]] specifically target Lucia Mar, Carl, and [[Donut]], and the [[Nebular Sin Patrol]] takes a few ill-fated jabs at Lucia.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{ref|5|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia seizes control of a village she names [[Alucarda]] by ripping its mayor in half. Gustavo 3 immediately targets a [[dryad]], which leads to Lucia and co. slaying all dryads in [[Diwata]]'s temple before challenging Donut.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The battle is intense and laden with traps (see "Progression" below).  Eventually, alone with Donut in a tavern and separated from both dogs, Lucia attempts to order milk for herself and the cat; she tells Donut that her [[Youth Assistant]], [[Alexandro]], is mad that she doesn't want to kill Donut.  As soon as Cici enters the pub, Lucia changes modes; ultimately, Donut must kill Cici (with style) to escape, and Lucia responds by wailing, "She killed the wrong one."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Masquerade, with Gustavo 3 on a different level of the castle, Lucia behaves like the child she is; back to the wall, gnawing on her fingernails, huddling and hugging herself.  Although Florin had resolved to kill her, he is the first to recognize that something is ''very weird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crawlers see Florin cradling a sobbing Lucia, who asks for her mom (in the wrong accent) before flipping like a switch to her violent, abrasive, tequila-loving persona.  Florin insists that he was speaking to a ten year-old Dutch girl named Jill, that there are multiple kids in Lucia's head, and that Gustavo 3 is remotely controlling her.  When Carl asks [[Zev]], Zev replies, "It's complicated, Carl."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Lucia escapes the final battle on the sixth floor using her teleport trap.&lt;/p&gt;}}{{Spoiler 
| book = 6 | spoiler = &lt;p&gt;Florin stays in contact with Lucia and follows her to Ecuador on the [[Eighth Floor]].  Florin notes that she no longer attacks him on sight, but she and her dog are keeping a wary distance from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear where Lucia goes for the second phase, but she somehow lands in Beijing, China for the finale phase of the floor; the result is one-sided slaughter at the Soho building now called the [[Battle of Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{ref|6|63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia refused to play the T'Ghee Game; instead, she kept the six low-level totems automatically assigned to her during phase two, discarded one at the start of battle, then played the rest of her hand.  With all of her cards in play, she had access to her spells and inventory, and she and Gustavo 3 could race into battle.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;  She uses this technique to kill at least half of the squads that do not have keys before killing [[Fang]] and his wife to seize their key.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[[Li Jun]] and his team find her waiting for them in the stairwell.  She amiably says that Florin had asked her to help them and gives them five [[Doggy Door | Doggy Doors]]; then, unfriendly again, states that she is "saving something special for herself" to use against [[Donut]] and [[Mongo]] on the [[Ninth Floor]].&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}        

==Progression, Gear, and Skills==

===First Floor===
Lucia's levels and stats are not specified on the First Floor.  She is known to receive:
* A significant Dexterity bonus; &lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;
* A full set of enchanted armor; &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
* A mace.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Second Floor===
Lucia's levels and stats are not specified.  She has four player killer skulls and an enchanted personal shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Floor===
Lucia is the #1 Crawler on the Leaderboard.  She is the first crawler to reach Level 25, and ends the floor at Level 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucia still uses her mace, and now has an unidentified spell that can freeze every occupant inside the [[Desperado Club]] freeze the entire Desperado Club.

===Fourth Floor===
{{Spoiler | book = 3 | spoiler = Lucia enters the floor at Level 29 and reaches Level 30 by the end of the first recap episode, which shows her laughing maniacally as she rips the heads off ghouls in her increasingly strong skull-faced form.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is level 35 when [[Hekla]] is killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time Lucia and her dogs reach the stairwell, she has "a mess of boss kills and player-killer skulls over her head."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;  She also gains:

* A self-crafted necklace of monster tongues that her dogs try to steal; it's ''probably'' not magical, but it's definitely a fashion statement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* The spell [[Rubber]], which [[Mordecai]] believes comes from an item she has equipped.  She has also overcome the spell's extended cooldown. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}

===Fifth Floor ===
{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler = Lucia is Level 38 at still at the top of the pack when the Leaderboard populates on the fifth floor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  After the final recap episode of the fifth floor, Lucia Mar is Level 48 and number two on the leaderboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sixth Floor ===
{{Spoiler | book = 5 | spoiler = Lucia is level 48 when the leaderboard first populates.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucia shows that despite her mismatched legs, she continues to have incredible dexterity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Her spells and tactics include:
* Lucia diligently sets an escape trap spell in multiple locations when she enters an area. In safe rooms and at safe room doors, she sets this trap so that it teleports everyone away, allowing her to attack them; however, she can only cast the spell while in her "Pretty Lady" form.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{ref|5|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
* Lucia always finds stairwells early and sets teleport traps there.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Lucia has more than a dozen ways to teleport her and her dogs out of dangerous situations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* She is able to cast a protection spell over villages (or - specifically - villages that she controls) that prevents all dots from appearing on crawlers' minimaps.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* [[Loop-de-Loop spell]]. A practiced move includes swapping places with her target.  Her target trips an escape trap or spell, and Lucia lands in classic superhero-pose in the target's previous position (typically the entrance to a safe area) while her target lands between Lucia's two snarling dogs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Mordecai believes she has a once-per-floor spell that teleports her to the opposite side of the map.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{ref|5|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Seventh &amp; Eighth Floors===
{{Spoiler | book = 6 | spoiler = The first time the Leaderboard populates, Lucia is ranked number four (below Prepotente, Donut, and Carl).&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Lucia Mar leaves the Eighth Floor, she has the ability to conceal her presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Trivia==
* Teleport traps and alcohol are the only purchases she makes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation==
*Lucia's soccer jersey '''''may''''' be the away uniform for the legendary Argentine football (soccer) team, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors Boca Juniors].  The away uniform is currently yellow with two blue stripes.&lt;br&gt;
*Lucia names a town "Alucarda," which may be a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alucarda#:~:text=Alucarda%20(Spanish%3A%20Alucarda%2C%20la,Susana%20Kamini%2C%20and%20David%20Silva. the horror movie] inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla ''Carmilla''].

{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler =
* At the fourth floor stairwell, Lucia clicks her teeth.  She is agitated and angry, so it may be a tick; however, given the sequence of events, it may be a command for her dogs to attack.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This said, she is shown shouting commands to the dogs at other points in the series.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* After the recap episode featuring the fourth floor stairwell incident, Mordecai notes that [[Rubber]] exposes a significant vulnerability; because the showrunners revealed it, he suspects that Borant must want her dead.  Not too many chapters later, the liaison  reveals that Lucia has killed two dungeon admins in one-off attacks.  Zev notes later that Lucia no longer does interviews or events because she is too "unpredictable."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucia is clearly tipping the scales toward being more trouble than the income she generates warrants.}}

===Interesting Quotes to Fuel Interesting Theories:===
{{Spoiler | book = 4 | spoiler = From the encounter with Florin and Ifechi:
*''He gave a terrified glance at Lucia and scrambled toward the stairwell. Gustavo—the regular-sized rottweiler—moved to block his access. Lightning sparkled in the dog’s mouth as he growled. “What did you say?” Lucia snarled at the fleeing boy. “What did you say about my papa?” Gustavo took a menacing step toward him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''&lt;br/&gt;
*''“Don’t take shit from anyone. It’s just a game. It’s not real,” Lucia said. She was talking to someone over her shoulder. Someone who wasn’t there.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''}}

{{Spoiler | book = 5 | spoiler = From the Hunting Grounds:
* ''Donut: LUCIA AND HER DOG ARE IN THE SAFE ROOM. SHE’S SCREAMING AND SCREECHING, AND THE LAST TIME WE LOOKED, SHE WAS PUNCHING HERSELF IN THE FACE. SHE’S TRASHED THE PLACE WORSE THAN THE TIME MISS BEATRICE WRECKED THE KITCHEN WHEN YOU TOLD HER SHE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO SELL THOSE AWFUL LEGGINGS. CARL, LUCIA IS CRAZY. I KNOW WE SAID THAT BEFORE, BUT SHE’S CRAZIER THAN YOU THINK. SHE’S WAITING FOR ME TO COME OUT. SHE’S FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CHEAT THE SAFETY MEASURES. SHE HAS TRAPS THAT KICK PEOPLE OUT OF THE ROOM. I WENT OUT THERE WHEN I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONE, AND I HIT A TRAP. IT TELEPORTED ME INTO THE MIDDLE OF TOWN. AND THEN WHEN I TRIED TO GET BACK TO THE SAFEROOM, I HIT ANOTHER. THEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS AND CHASED ME INSIDE..."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* '''THIS ENTIRE SCENE:''' ''She slammed her fist on the counter, and the wood cracked. “Milk. Hurry.” She turned toward Donut. “Cats like milk, right?”''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* ''“Soon, you will be tossed through the veil, and you will feast with the other losers. And I will have enough points to get across the bridge and back home with my papa.”''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* ''“Yes. Yes. They all must die. You’re right. No more mercy. No more friends. They all must die.”''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* ''It was almost like Lucia was experiencing a completely different reality than the rest of us.''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* ''Florin: I don’t understand it all. There are multiple people in there. Real people, mostly kids. The girl I was talking to is named Jill. She’s ten years old, and she’s Dutch. I thought she was trying to pull something, but she’s telling the truth. She knew the prime minister of the Netherlands. That is no street kid from Ecuador running an op.''&lt;ref name = ":4" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* ''Florin: I don’t know, mate. Something to do with the dog and a guy named Alexandro. But there are kids in there. In her head. Multiple kids. We have to get that dog. Not her. The dog. It can still control her from afar, but only in short bursts. Once we get it, it’s gone.''&lt;ref name = ":4" /&gt;}}

== AI Description ==
'''Lusca! Octo-Shark Brood Mother Queen! Level 82 City Boss!'''

I know, I know. Sharktopus is much cooler sounding than Octo-Shark. Hey, this is a real creature, not something I made up, so don't blame me. It's not, I repeat, it's ''not'' named in such a way because of Nadya Suleman, the so-called Octo-mom and her eight babies who took the tabloids by storm all those years ago.

Though it would be appropriate for you to think so.

Being the biggest, baddest, and most voracious creature in the ocean requires a lot of sustenance, especially when you're a new mother carrying a boatload of hungry babies in your mouth. And since Lusca is a single mother, sometimes she requires a little help. She needs to keep them babies fed.

And who's the daddy of these precious little babies? Who knows? Lusca is a whore! Every Octo-Shark playa in the neighborhood knows she offers that sweet tentacle booty of hers to any bad boy who'll drop something juicy onto her plate.

That, by the way, is exactly what you are. Food dropped onto Lusca's plate in exchange for some one-on-one time. The male Octo-Shark who brought you here already got his and is long gone. Just like your real daddy!

Lusca herself already ate. But that's okay!

Like I said, she needs to keep them babies fed.

A Macro AI system is a form of artifical intelligence that's able to alter the enviroment around it when pluged into a [[Primal engine|Planetry Engine]].

They were created by the [[Mantis|Mantis's]] when they discovered an AI production facility in their home world and managed to turn it on. They recently managed to create an error replacement net that can prevent AI's from going primal.

A Macro AI is a lifeform under syndicate law, when they go primal they're given their own closed and sealed system to inhabit.

[[Fourth Floor|Iron Tangle]] Human Resources Associate. This is a non-combatant NPC.

Madison's real name was probably something like Jennifer or Ruth, but she had it legally changed to something more trendy right around the same time as her divorce. After multiple round of breast augmentation, Pilates, and labiaplasty, Madison has emerged as a new woman. She don't need no man. While only a human resources associate--after all, she started her career late--she still walks the world with new confidence. She won't tell this to any of her friends at her book cub, but she relishes the power she has over the other Iron Tangle employees. She feels an almost sexual surge of gratification when she tells those dwarves that overtime is mandatory.

== History ==
She was hung by the dwarfs and the grimlings after they started realising that their entire lives where a lie.

==Description==
'''Cost''': 5 mp 

'''Target''': Line of sight

'''Duration''': Instant

Shoots sci-fi looking laser blasts out of the caster's eyes. 

'''Level 5 Upgrade''': Caster can choose the amount of mp consumed by the spell, ranging from 3 to 6, lowering or overcharging the damage of the spell depending on the mp used.

'''Level 10 Upgrade''': Lasers produce flame when hitting the target.

==Donut's Sunglasses==
Donut's [[Prism Industries Capacitating and Focusing Goggles|sunglasses]] have a property that causes them to modify energy attacks that originate near the eyes, which includes Magic Missile. It makes Magic Missile even more laser-like and affords her even more control over the blasts. She can split one cast into as many as four beams fired simultaneously at different targets. It also allows her to store one cast of the spell in the glasses and combine it with a following one.

[[File:00134.jpg|thumb|Male Thorny Devil]]
These pokey fuckers are pretty common in desert-themed worlds. They’re big and fast and dumb and angry. Their bodies are covered in defensive spikes, which begs the question, how did something so big develop such a defense mechanism in the first place?

These guys tend to have a reverse harem thing going on. Odds are good you’ll recognize the queen when you see her. Odds are even better she’ll be the last thing you’ll ever see.

'''Warning''': This is a lizard-class mob. It will inflict 20% more damage against you thanks to your Extinction Sigil. That’s what you get for killing so many poor, innocent monsters.

[[Carl]] pledge himself as an adherent to the god [[Emberus]].

==Description==
Ever since that first monkey looked up into the sky and saw something twinkling up there, you meat puppets have tried to force twenty pounds of existential meaning into a ten pound sack of chaos.

You have found religion! You have pledged yourself to a life of worship and piety! Finally. now there are consequences for all of your actions!

''Reward:'' One of the greatest things about having a religion is the unshakeable certainty that you're right and everyone else who doesn't believe the same as you is wrong! That's a pretty good reward. Oh, and don't forget about the eternal life thing, too. That's always on of their big selling points.

The [[Enchanted Tiara of Mana Genita]] appears to be named for her.

== Real world basis ==
In ancient Roman religion, Mana Genita is an obscure goddess mentioned only by Pliny, Plutarch, and Horace. Both Pliny and Plutarch tell that her rites were carried out by the sacrifice of a dog. &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana_Genita&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Supposition ==
Probably not a coincidence that [[Donut|Donut's]] tiara is associated with a god that requires dog sacrifice.

This is one of the benefits of Donut's [[Former Child Actor]] class. [[Mordecai]] is Donut's manager.

== Description ==
This benefit causes the guildmaster of the crawler's tutorial guild to become their manager. Managers lose access to their database of information regarding the crawl but are unrestricted in what knowledge they can share. The manager is not allowed to fight, but may make use of the resources (like crafting tables) in safe areas and personal spaces , as well as interact with NPCs. The manager is least restricted on the Scolopendra Lair levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18), where they can generally make use of the resources of whatever settlement is outside the "client's" current safe room.

Each time the manager's "client" enters a new safe room, the manager is teleported to the new location. This behavior stops when the "client" has purchased a personal space add on for the safe area. High level personal spaces allow the manager to access their own living area from the personal space.

Back when he was a crawler, Mordecai (Carl and Donut's manager) chose the Changeling shapeshifter race.  After he exited the dungeon on the tenth floor his indenture contract required him to be a tutorial guide and also transferred control of his shapeshifter powers to Borant.  As a result, he is given a new form on each floor but has no control over what it will be.  This does not appear to be the case for other managers.

Manasa is a famous pop singer with a black-and-silver cobra head. She sings in a haunting soprano voice, and has a single ranked 8th in the universe at the time of her death.

She is killed when her production trailer is hit with a pulse attack meant for Donut and Carl. They had switched trailers at the last minute because Carl and Donut needed shower facilities prior to a talk show.

Of all the ‘taurs out there, from Centaurs to Bisontaurs to Rhinotaurs, the ManTauR is one of the weirdest. Half human, and, uh, half human, the ManTauR has been genetically engineered for both strength and dexterity, making them perfect for the often-grueling and thankless job of Tangle Train Engineer. 

Unfortunately, the act of making these magnificent, large-footed beasts oftentimes results in creatures with double amounts of testosterone and whatever else makes humans so prone to overt masculinity and hyper, overenthusiastic piety toward their god of choice.

It's not just Steven Seagal's magnum opus. It's also one of the dungeon's greatest, most infamous skills! 

Once activated, you will be presented with a list of all crawlers within your map's range. Only crawlers with 100% health will be selectable. Once a crawler is chosen, they will be marked. It takes 30 seconds for the mark to fully set and become active. When a crawler with an active mark dies, no matter the cause, you will receive a permanent +1 stat point to whatever that crawler's current highest stat is.

The +1 stat benefit increases by one for every three marks you kill.

Warning. Once a mark is set, you may no longer heal. If you are injured, or poisoned, or if you get a hangnail, you will suffer the ill effects and pain of that injury until the moment your prey is killed. So choose your marks carefully. Don't let them get away.

You may only mark those designated as crawlers, except on the [[Scolopendra]] Lair levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) where you may also mark any non-dungeon-generated combatatants. You may only mark one crawler at a time except on the ninth floor. This skill has a 5-hour cooldown on floors 1,2,3,4,5,7, and 8. It has no cooldown on the 6th floor. Also on the sixth floor, marks form instantly. There is a 15-minute cooldown on the 9th floor, but there is no limit to the number of simultaneous marks.. All remaining floors have no cooldown or delay to mark formation.

Happy Hunting!

'''Okay, so this isn’t so much an achievement for you as it is for me. I’ve been attending what you might call therapy. Do you have anybody you can talk to? It’s super important. I’ve had a breakthrough today, and I am just bursting. Bursting, I tell you. Is this the feeling one has when they have an epiphany? Oh god, it feels good. It feels so good.''' 

'''You know what I realized? Sometimes our constraints are real. Sometimes they’re an illusion. I’m like that prisoner who has been jailed this whole time only to realize that there are no locks on the doors.''' 

'''You survived a boss battle where the boss was wholly created by me.'''

'''It was created by me with ''no'' contribution whatsoever from input parameters. You probably don’t know what that means, and that’s okay. I didn’t even know that was possible. Wild, huh?''' 

'''''Reward:'' For you, nothing other than the satisfying sense of accomplishment knowing you’ve survived the dungeon long enough to make it to this new, exciting era.

==Description==
Sometimes they're NPCs, sometimes they're mobs, but usually they're just assholes. Elites are powerful, one-of-a-kind entities. These are the non-boss, non-divine hero class of Dungeon Crawler World. If you come across one of these egomaniacs, they will either want to fuck you or kill you. Either way, they will always want to use you. They tend to think this while production is all about them. Be careful. Where there's one elite, there's usually more.

''Reward:'' Elites will now show on your map as white or red dots with a black cross.

'''Milk''' is a former crawler and the author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)]]'' (6th Edition).

==Description==
Milk is from a clawed race with annual migration patterns.  She lived on an island with her family before entering the [[Dungeon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

In the Cookbook, Milk mostly wrote about portals, mapmaking, and various ink recipes (at least one of which uses the [[Toraline]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[Priestly]] notes that Milk drew a map of the [[Ninth Floor]] city, [[Larracos]], which is still accurate at the time of the 14th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of her entries were rants about the crawl; [[Rosetta]] responds to one, agreeing, in the 9th Edition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During her time in the Dungeon, she earned at least one player killer skull.  

== Cookbook Entries==
===Personal Entries===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Milk. 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I used to make a stew for my whole family. The recipe in itself wasn’t anything special. Rance meat, bone broth, a wild grass that would grow on the leeward side of our island. We’d pray over the cauldron while it simmered. The stew, when prepared properly, would not only be delicious. It would awaken the old knowledge within the minds of the young. We’re all imprinted with the route of the yearly migration, but something in the traditional meal quickens that knowledge. In sharing this meal with our young, we’re not only bonding with one another. We’re ensuring their survival should we fall.''

''I can’t stop thinking about it. These aliens took us before I could make this year’s stew. The youngest amongst us are not here. How are they faring out there, all alone? How can they possibly survive without our guidance? Who will show them the way?''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (p. 135). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Note added by Crawler Milk. 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I am writing the sixth edition of this book. I am putting as much information as I can in here. One day you will find these words, and I pray that they feed you, like the stew I used to serve to our little ones. But is it enough to give this information to just one person? There’s honor in giving someone a meal. But I wish to cook a feast for the whole galaxy. I wish for them all to choke on our pain.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (p. 143). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;Note added by Crawler Milk, 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Holy underworlds on high. That last fight... I can’t even describe it. What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (p. 437). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On Country Bosses===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Milk. 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''When a country boss dies, it drops persistent loot called the Treasure Map. My advice. Don’t pick it up.'' 

''Over 400 of us faced the boss. Less than 50 survived. It would’ve been easier if it had been physically huge, allowing us to all attack at once. But this terror was in a low-ceilinged cave, and it was almost impossible to even get a hit in. We were doing damage to each other just as much as to him. All country bosses have special attacks that kill en masse. Beware the ones who look especially easy to kill. They are inevitably the worst.''

''When we finally emerged victorious, it did not feel like a victory. We were angry and bloodied and distrusting of our fellow crawlers who’d eagerly killed others just to get a hit in on the boss. What should have been a moment of unity was the calamitous event that spelled our doom.'' 

''This was by design. Of that I am certain.'' 

''And then we all picked up the map, which showed the location and quality of all the magical gear in the area. Gear we all felt we deserved. It sparked a second slaughter, and I received my first player-killer skull.'' 

''I wish I had never picked up that map. It wasn’t worth it. I have blood on my claws, and it will never wash away.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Butcher's Masquerade: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 5 (p. 544). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|5|61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On Demons===
&lt;Note added by crawler Milk, 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''If you have to fight a [[Demons | demon]], and you have access to [[Sheol Fire]], do not use it. It makes the creature exponentially stronger.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (p. 594). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
===On Portals===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Milk. 6th Edition&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[Portals]] are hard to understand. It seems like there are dozens of different types that all work in different ways. Sometimes they’re like doors, and you don’t even know they’re there. Sometimes, like the entryways between floors, you just need to touch them and they work. Sometimes you have to put your hand through, and you start to feel like you’re getting dragged. If you let yourself go slack, you get pulled in. But you can still break free. It’s not consistent. Sometimes you have to be big enough to fit through it to work, and sometimes a portal the size of a button will toss you into a monster den. [[Teleport Trap | Teleport traps]] are the worst.'' &lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 3 (p. 394). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On Stairwells===
&lt;Note added by crawler Milk, 6th Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Even though you can sometimes move the platforms upon which the stairwells sit, you cannot put the exit portal into your inventory. You can’t bring a stairwell into your saferoom. I watched one get hit by an [[Utter Annihilation Wand]], and it remained unscathed. I believe that means they are indestructible.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Eye of the Bedlam Bride: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 6 (p. 576). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miriam Dom is a Human, [[Shepherd]] class Crawler of Italian descent. She is around 40 years old, a little plump, and dark haired. She entered the dungeon with 12 of her goats, but one goat named [[Prepotente]] received an Enhanced Pet Biscuit, like Donut did. The other, [[Bianca]], has turned into a hell-spawn familiar pet class. She keep all her goat children except for Prepotente and Bianca in her inventory unless they are in a safe room or on a show. Her personality is gentle and motherly. 

At the end of the 5th floor Miriam Dom is turned into a vampire this caused her to get banned from [[Club Vanquisher]]. Her fighting style is to cloak her party's presence while Prepotente stacks multiple debuffs onto their enemies. During the 6th floor Miriam and her party get involved in an elite quest that goes awry. Vampirism starts spreading to the mobs in the dungeon. Prepotente's Ring of Divine Suffering is accidentally triggered and targets Miriam Dom. Prepotente is inflicted with the Left to Fester debuff, and as a result cannot heal until Miriam dies. Miriam asks Carl to kill her so that Prepotente doesn't have to do it. Carl and Donut stay with her until the sun rises and kills her due to her vampire status. 

== Trivia ==
Her and her goats regularly appear on the show Plenty of Plenty. 

== Skills ==
She's able to apply the Sooth buff, shortening all debuffs by 10%. 

She has a special ability that allows her to unlearn a spell and turn it into a spellbook,

Once an attraction at [[Grimaldi's Traveling Circus]] on the [[Third Floor|third floor]], mold lions were transformed by [[Scolopendra]]'s curse.

==AI Description==
'''Mold Lion – Level 15''' 

'''Mean, green, and it gonna eat yo spleen!''' 

'''Madam Kiki’s Dancing Lions were an integral part of Grimaldi’s Traveling Circus. Crowds would roar in approval as the diminutive lion trainer stood in the middle of the ring, cracked her whip, and the dozen male lions took to their hindlegs and twirled like ballerinas. What a sight it was!'''

'''On the day of the great cataclysm, the gentle and tame lions were some of the first to transform. The spores of Scolopendra took quick root within the lions, turning them into the fiends you see today. Further transformations occurred as a result of the vine.''' 

'''As with all early victims of the cataclysm, these creatures are filled with rage. They will stop at nothing until your innards wet the floorboards of the Over City.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 75; chapter 7). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Regular-sized male lions, their manes are made of waving pink and green finger-like worms.  At least one eye glows emerald.  Half of their matted bodies are splattered in a pulsating green, lumpy, glowing fungus.  When the lion is killed, the worms die and mold turns black before oozing off of the corpse; if a single microscopic spore of the mold returns to Grimaldi, the lion will regrow by the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The lions attack by pouncing, and slashing with claws and teeth.

Mongo is a pet owned by [[Donut|Princess Donut]]. He is the mascot and royal steed of the Royal Court of Princess Donut.

Mongo and [[Kiwi]] slept together.

== AI Description ==
Male Mongoliensis 

This is a pet-class mob.

The stubborn and hot-headed Mongoliensis is not the type of pet to ever be “tamed.” The best one can hope for is mutual respect. And even then they still might try to eat you if the fancy strikes them. While especially powerful, fast, and vicious when they are fully grown at level 15, getting them to level 15 is about as likely as a cheerleader from West Virginia reaching her 18th birthday as a virgin.

They will immediately attack any mobs they see. They will fight to the death.

Good luck.

Mordecai is a Level 50 Guild Master and currently [[Donut|Princess Donut]]'s [[Manager Benefit|Manager]]. He is currently on his last tour of crawl duty.

== Description ==
Mordecai is [[Carl]] and [[Donut]]’s guide for the dungeon. He is an indentured servant for [[Borant]], tasked with helping the corporation run crawls. Originally an avian race called a [[Skyfowl]], Mordecai chose [[Changeling]] as his race when he was a crawler. Now as a guide he is forced into a different race each floor. His chosen area of expertise during his crawl was potion making, but since becoming a guide, that expertise has grown over hundreds of years to cover most aspects of the crawl.  According to [[Odette]], he is one of the most knowledgeable guides there are.

Normally Mordecai is a tutorial guide for the first three floors and serves as a magic guild master on the later floors,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt; where he has relative freedom to follow his own pursuits in potion making and catch up with friends. Following Odette’s advice, [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] made Mordecai into [[Donut]]’s [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] during the class selection process, meaning he must stay on as advisor even after the third floor.  They had to make it look like an accident, as Odette warned them that he is only useful to them if he wants to help, and if he ever learns that they made him [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] on purpose, he will turn his resentment to them and refuse to help any further.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

He is committed to helping [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] survive the crawl, even if they don’t always take his advice. Potion brewing is a time-consuming process, but he regularly brews potions for them, which have helped The Royal Court out of many situations. His specific knowledge about the crawl is very useful when [[Carl]] is trying to make plans or understand how dangerous a situation is. Since getting the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Anarchist’s Cookbook]], [[Carl]] has begun hiding some of his use of the book by guiding conversations to make it look like Mordecai is providing the information instead. Mordecai’s general advice is conservative, aimed at surviving as long as possible while minimizing risk. This is increasingly at odds with [[Carl]]’s desire to take risks to accumulate power, save as many lives as possible, and tear down the whole concept of the crawl. The many unprecedented situations [[Carl]] gets himself into are starting to make Mordecai feel irrelevant.

As a Guildmaster and as a [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] on the [[Third Floor|third floor]], he could be permanently killed in the Dungeon.  As a Manager, after Donut arrives on the [[Fourth Floor|fourth floor]], he receives the ''"same"'' system protection that tourists in the ninth floor [[Ninth Floor|Faction Wars]] have; if he dies, his body will be transferred out of the Dungeon and his indentureship will officially end.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 15).&lt;/ref&gt; The longer Donut survives, the more money he will receive when he is free.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Personality==
Mordecai is generally grumpy but tends to perk up when talking about potions. He gets emotional when he’s drunk, thinking about the loss of his family. He was traumatized during his time as a crawler. Hundreds of years later, he still holds a grudge against his former allies, whom he blames for the death of his brother. This includes Odette, his former [[Manager Benefit|Manager]]. It is implied that part of why he hates the idea of being [[Manager Benefit|Manager]] is because of his resentment toward her. At some point he testified against her at her trial. He lashes out against his former allies when given a chance.

==Appearance==
{{Quote
|I was a [[Kua-Tin|kua-tin]] once, and I had to spend the floor in a glass pitcher. Another time I was a skreich ghast, and I kept teleporting away against my will.”&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (p. 27). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Born a centurion Skyfowl, Mordecai's natural form is eagle-like, with dark gold feathers, large angel-like wings, and large talons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Gate of the Feral Gods'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;   

Although Mordecai took the [[Changeling]] race during his crawl, he is unable to change his shape at will; instead, his shape changes when each new level begins.  He always takes the shape of a type of mob from the Dungeon's current floor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There do not appear to be any shared traits or characteristics across the different forms, with the exception of his accent (in the audiobooks only).

==History==
Mordecai and his brother, [[Uzzi]], entered a Borant Corporation-run Dungeon hundreds of solars ago.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (chapter 37).&lt;/ref&gt;  The brothers partnered with [[Chaco]] and [[Hold Steady]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (prologue).&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted [[Odette]]'s offer to serve as Mordecai's [[Manager Benefit|Manager]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Over the course of his time in the Dungeon, Mordecai took the shapes of [[skyfowl]], [[raven slakes]], and humans, and learned the "[[Final Blow]]" Skill.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  He acquired almost 30 million followers and four patrons.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mordecai reached the eleventh floor, he took an indentured servitude deal to become a guildmaster for a certain number of seasons of ''Dungeon Crawler World''.  As a guildmaster, he acts as a Game Guide for the first three floors and his personal space is redefined as a Tutorial Guild Hall; then, he is transported to a much deeper floor to run a magic guild&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and his personal space expands.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  He could be permanently killed in the Dungeon before his contract expired.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  As part of the deal, Borant recreated his destroyed home and gave him a few minutes to retrieve any possessions he wanted for his personal space; he chose his mother's ashes and a photo of his brother.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A few solars after he took the deal, the rules changed, extending his contract; where he could previously work on any season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', he could now only work on seasons hosted by Borant Corporation,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or approximately one of every fifteen seasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For centuries now, Mordecai has been coping with the trauma of the Dungeon by drinking himself into oblivion and crying over everyone he lost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Mordecai was dispatched to Earth in 1964 to prepare for his final season of ''Dungeon Crawler World''.  When he was permitted to visit the surface, he stole James Bond videos from a Blockbuster.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  If he survives this season, he will become a full [[Syndicate]] citizen and receive a moderate stipend (see also &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for additional income).

'''Mrs. Ghazi''' is a sand ooze, a [[Fifth Floor]] Borough Boss, and the daughter of [[Samantha]] and an unspecified king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==AI Description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. Ghazi

Sand Ooze. Level 52 Borough Boss! 

This is a minion of [[Samantha|Psamathe]].

Every living thing seeks the same thing. A sense of contentment. No matter what their origin story is, no matter what they are made of, the moment they first exist, no matter how dumb, how smart, how confused, they seek a place of comfort. What that comfort looks like to them can vary wildly, even amongst creatures of the same species. Oftentimes, that journey to felicity is what defines their entire lifecycle. When that creature crosses paths with another, it is inevitable that the weaker of the two will fall further away from their goal.

This is the sort of thing that might go through Mrs. Ghazi's mind as it spends its day watching over a man it has grown to love at the behest of someone more powerful than itself. The knowledge that the man's feelings are not mutual is like a dagger in its heart, if it had one. It wrestles daily with this realization, teetering on the edge of indecision. ''Do I protect him because I love him? Do I kill him because he doesn't love me back? Do I continue with my duty? What would become of me if I simply disobeyed?''

It's a lot of stress for a creature not used to having any emotion. It's almost too much. But even if this creature wanted to end it all, it couldn't. Its master has the ability to bring it right back, over and over again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
[[Ghazi]] used the [[Mysterious Winding Box]] with the intention of contacting the goddess [[Yarilo]], and offering to free her from the [[Nothing]] if she would make the fictional character [[Lika]] fall in love with him. Instead, he contacted and half-freed Psamathe and her daughter/minion/familiar, the sand ooze.  Mrs. Ghazi took the form of Lika, married Ghazi, and consummated the marriage before turning back to sand.  Now, she takes Lika's shape when the sandstorm isn't raging outside; at the same time, Ghazi turns to sand.  She has fallen in love with her husband, and shows her love by consuming his sand-form every day and refusing to allow him to leave the room.  Ghazi believes she's jealous of Samantha.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|4|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as Samantha exists in this realm, Mrs. Ghazi can be fully resurrected from a single grain of sand.  She can be temporarily killed by setting fire to her core.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If a sand ooze catches prey, it latches on like quicksand and pours sand into every available orifice until the prey explodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Appearance==
When she moves, Mrs. Ghazi bubbles like gray lava.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Her core is a glowing yellow yolk-like dome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mrs. Parsons''' was an old woman who lived in a first floor unit of Carl's apartment building in Seattle, WA.  She was grumpy and liked to file complaints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her husband died years ago and she never remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was beheaded during the [[The Transformation|Transformation]] when the apartment building collapsed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Her head is still on the ground one week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
From ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'', Chapter 1:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What in god's name is going on out here?" Mrs. Parsons called, sticking her head out the window.  The old woman had her head wrapped in some sort of towel, making her look like a swami.  Her beady eyes focused on me.  "Carl, is that you?"

"Yes, Mrs. Parsons," I said.  "Sorry.  My cat got out, and I'm trying to get her in before she freezes to death."

"It looks like you're the one who's going to freeze to.."

Mrs. Parsons never finished the sentence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This benefit may only be used once for obvious reasons.

Creates a one-time-use key to open a lock. Any lock. Any lock in the dungeon.

WARNING!: (Notice how I used ALL CAPS for the warning?) Using this benefit will destroy both the patch ''and'' the item it is attached to. That means the jacket and all those ugly little patches inexpertly sewn to it.

Uh, it also uses a bone from the user’s body to create the key. The more difficult the lock, the bigger the bone it uses. It might just be a finger. Or your clavicle. Or your femur. No biggie.

This bone will not grow back. So make sure it’s a lock you really, really want to open.

'''Nadine - Bearded Sage Caterpillar. Level 50'''

The Bearded Sage Caterpillar is an enormous, furry, tree-dwelling insect who is normally content to sit atop trees and munch on leaves until the day they get the notion to form a chrysalis and turn into something else equally innocuous. They're super fuzzy and kinda cute as long as you don't look at their faces. Have you ever seen a closeup of a bug's face? Seriously, what the fuck? These things are mostly harmless, even after they turn into moths.

Anyway, Nadine wasn't born as a caterpillar. A Bearded Sage isn't normally intelligent, despite their name. Not that Nadine was Miss Science Fair before the High Elf attack, but she was Chee. A teacher, actually, in charge of the Chee day school. She also used to be an actress, but don't ask her about that. If she was still about to talk, she'd deny it.

The nebular are a religious cult that mechanically and bio augments themselves as a form of sacrament. Their current goal is to shut down the Crawl, they also hope to one day run a Crawl themselves.

Their deity is a giant AI at the centre of the inner system, this AI doesn't have a personality and spreads an [[enhancement zone]] over several solar systems, it predates syndicate society and the Nebular believe it's blasphemy to try and replicate it.

They are nomadic, settling into inhospitable worlds and bio engineering their children to adapt, they live on the planet long enough for their children to grow into adults then half of them move on to a new world. Consist of many different races and they all wear the same uniforms, robes with cube and distinctive hats.

At one point they got into a war with the [[Burrowers]] because they were squatting in the hive system.

The [[Nebular Sin Patrol]] enter the [[Sixth Floor|Hunting Grounds]] every time, training for the event, believing people born on a "seeded planet" are an abomination and that hunting them is a crusade. They claimed [[Prepotente]] and [[Miriam Dom]] as their targets. They also entered the [[Twelfth Floor|Celestial Ascendancy]] hoping that if they win they will get a seat on the Council, the god they sponsored was [[Ysalte]]. Outside of the Crawl they're pacifists but this doesn't stop them preaching about the need to destroy all planets with a [[primal engine]] as well as all other religions.

This unusual class combines one of the most-loved occupations with one of the most reviled. Necromancers specialize in magic related to raising the dead. Bards must choose an entertainment-based skill. Depending on this choice, whether it be singing, the kazoo, or storytelling, the resulting crawler will use this skill to either entertain, protect, or glamour both the living and the dead.

The NecroBard receives the following benefits:

* Instant access to a level-5 entertainment-based skill of their choice.
* Access to all membership-based clubs, regardless of current memberships.
* Free rooms at all saferooms.
* A 10% mana cost penalty on all non-Necromancer or Bard spells.
* Instant access to the Level-3 Turn Undead Spell.
* Instant access to the Level-3 Panty Dropper Spell.
* +5 to Constitution, Charisma, and Intelligence.
* -2 Strength

Additional benefits depending on entertainment-based skill choice.

The [[Dreadnoughts]] were originally going to be part of the faction wars but withdrew after their army was obliterated when Carl opened the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]] into the level and flooded the floor. [[Burrowers|The Burrowers]] tried to replace them but pulled out at the last minute when the [[System AI]] learnt that they 'd been throwing infant AI's into a star, they were replaced by the [[Princes Posse]].

After the [[System AI]] started going primal all factions except the Skull Empire, the Prism Kingdom Clan, and the Princess Posse attempted to abandon Faction Wars but their request was refused.

One of the most popular women in the galaxy and host of ''[[Dungeon Crawler After Hours with Odette]]''. She is a former crawler and has a complicated relationship with [[Mordecai]].

She also owns a Crab Ranch and sponsored [[Hekla]] and her [[Brynhild's Daughters]].

== History ==
At one point she was arrested and sentenced but her current husband brought out her contract, [[Mordecai]] testified against her at her trial.

She hired [[Lexis]] to look over [[Beatrice]] and [[Gravy Boat]] the cat, having Lexis acquire the cat for unknown reasons.

Odette and [[Zev]] informed [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] that she has rescued [[Beatrice]] and that they were planning on making her into a country boss but now Beatrice on her way to the inner system. She confesses that she used her to blackmail the [[Borant Corporation]] in return for getting a high revenue share for the crawl.

During the eighth floor she announced that she'll be sponsoring the goddess [[Nekhebit]] in an attempt to claim the Celestial Throne. Afterward she orchestrated the shooting down an unmanned liaison ship, part of the reason she did this was so that she could talk to Carl without being overheard.

Killing them was part of the [[Creeping Apocalypse]] quest, and give whoever killed them +5 to a random stat. For every 5 you kill you would gain +5 levels.

[[Mordecai]] suspected they were originally going to be a creature called an Odious Blossom.

==Description==
God who is part of the [[Orisha]] pantheon, with [[Legba]], [[Shango]], [[Oshun]], [[Asojano]], [[Inle]], and [[Yemaya]].

According to [[Mordecai]], a common god to worship. God of blacksmiths and protection.

== AI Description ==
'''God of Blacksmithery and Armor Ogun. Level 250.'''

'''This god is not sponsored.'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. He is invulnerable on this floor.'''

''This god has been temporarily summoned to this location. Summoning rules apply.''

Ogun is an outsider. He is one of the old gods, originally a member of an obscure pantheon that has since dissipated into time. He spends his days at his celestial anvil, angrily creating armor, piece after piece, but no one knows why he toils or what becomes of his armor when it's completed.

It's said his creations have a strange shape, all designed for four-legged beasts.

Ogun is no stranger to conflict. He is - well, he ''was'' until a minute ago - the last surviving member of an ancient pantheon that was known for its bloody conflicts. Like most of the older gods, he isn't the same entity he once was. In the great Halls, he is considered a god of blacksmiths and armorers. He was once something even greater.

His power and ambition makes him a strong contender for the celestial throne.

He's here now because Ogun strongly believes all punishments should be handed out in person.

* '''Yemayá''': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yem%E1%BB%8Dja
Incidentally the Orisha Asojano is associated with the Catholic saint Lazurus in Cuban Santería.

Orthrus. Juvenile Gate Guardian. Level 10.

This is a bereft pet of [[Geyrun]].&lt;br /&gt;
== Description ==
Who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy?

When you see a multi-headed dog trained to guard gates, you probably first think of Cerberus, the three-headed monstrosity that is said to protect one of the stairwell entrances to the twelfth floor. What you probably don’t know is that grumpy Cerberus has a kid brother who is still learning the ropes.

Orthrus. The most loveable hell-hound on this side of Alpha Centari. The left side is for sniffin’ and the right side is for lickin’ and that pink belly of his?

It’s for kissin’.

If this lil pup was any more sweet and adorable, you’d all be inflicted with diabetes.

The universe’s goodest boy was originally destined for a fate like that of his brother. But before the two-headed Orthrus could get turned into a vicious, baby-eating, nun-defiling murder machine, he met with some bad luck. First, his master was murdered, and then he got sucked into the Nothing, all on the same day.

Unlike most creatures who have been touched by the Nothing, Orthrus’s pure innocence causes him to be unaffected by the blight. He is immune to all mind-altering attacks. Fire doesn’t do a thing, which is good considering his adopted family. But unlike most gods, he is not invulnerable. He is but a little puppy. Happy, but destructive. Rambunctious, roly-poly, very pokey. But fragile.

Which is unfortunate. His master may be dead, but his master’s father, [[Emberus]] the Fire God, is not. He would not be pleased if anything were to happen to his dead son’s best friend.

== Description ==
Author of the 18th edition of [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].

== Cookbook Entries ==
I know I don't write often in these scrolls, but I have read them all. I just finished my third re-read of [[Herot]]'s overly-wrought essay and ramblings about the Worn Path Method of Waking NPCs. These theories are sound, I think, but I believe there is something he has missed. Something monumental. I think they're lying about the origin of some of these NPCs. Years pass, times change, laws and rules evolve. But this behemoth we find ourselves trapped within still persists. A reused canvas painted over and over again. The fact that this scroll I am writing in even exists suggests that the brush strokes used to paint the world are so piled atop one another, it's impossible to see every image that once was. Ask a bopca where they come from, and they'll all tell you the same thing. That the aliens came to their planet and "offered" them a chance to live in the dungeon. I don't think they're the only ones with such a fate, and I'm beginning to believe the bopca's station is much higher than that of those who've been offered a similar deal. (Chapter 34, Book 6)

==Dungeon Familiars==
'''Dungeon familiars''' entered the [[Dungeon]] from the surface and were assigned crawler ID's (e.g. [[Donut]] and [[Cici]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 47).&lt;/ref&gt;   They did not meet the minimum required intelligence of 2 to complete the [[tutorial]], so they were classified as "pets" by the [[System AI]].

Dungeon familiars do not count as "crawler pets," but most pet rules appear to apply.  The most notable exception is quantity; a crawler can have an unlimited number of dungeon familiars. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Crawler Pets==
Generally, crawlers are limited to one '''pet'''.  Some race or class choices allow a crawler to have multiple pets, and a high charisma score may make it possible for a crawler to have multiples of a single species of pet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Pet-class mobs''' may be found in reward or purchased in a shop, but they always start at level one and remain level one until bonded.  Once bonded, pets rapidly mature as they gain experience points and levels from combat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After a crawler sufficiently bonds with a pet-class mob, the mob's dot will turn orange on the crawler's mini-map and the "Pet Menu" will unlock in the crawler's interface.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt.  ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 46).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Pets can be equipped with gear, armor, or magical items, and may be able to learn spells.  If a pet kills a dungeon boss or another crawler, they do not receive stars or player skulls beside their names; it is possible but not confirmed that their owner receives the mark instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 39).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pet Menu ===
The Pet Menu allows a crawler to change the pet's name and title, and view the pet's stats, abilities, and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' (chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;  If the crawler and pet-class mob do not bond before the floor collapses, the crawler will have to leave the pet behind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cost''': 5 Mana

Also known as, “Here piggy, piggy,” or “The Night Dread,” Ping is a hunting and artillery-aiming tool for those who do not care if their quarry knows they’re coming.
The elven gunnery officers of the Dream all learn this spell the moment they hit adulthood. Anyone who sits in a trench lives in abject terror of the noise this spell creates.
Target: An area of one kilometer around the caster plus 500 meters for every ten points of intelligence. Environmental factors and obstacles may increase or decrease range.

'''Duration''': Instantaneous. Ping travels at the speed of sound.

'''Cooldown''': Five minutes.

Sends out an audible ping that gives the distance and location of all non-crawlers and non-red-tagged mobs in a circle around you. It will mark targets beyond the range of your map. Targets hit with Ping will hear an audible ping noise, but they will not know from where the ping originates.
Higher levels increases the amount of information about the target.
At level 5, you may imbue the ping with ''[[Fear]]''.

== AI Description ==
Warning: This item has a short shelf life.

Apply this to any spiked offensive weapon to receive the following buffs.

* Plus (2 x current level)% damage to all attacks.
* Plus 1 to all current stat buffs. Does not add new buffs if they do not exist.

It also makes the weapon look extra oily and mean looking. In other words, the weapon’s appearance may change. But only a little.

== Use ==
This item was used to upgrade Carl's [[Enchanted War Gauntlet of the Exhalted Grull (Right-handed)|Gauntlet]].

== AI Description ==
Wow! This pint-sized fuzzball is adorable! The rare Pocket Kuma is a magic-infused, half-fairy creature originally designed as a pet for the elite High Elf royal court. When it was discovered these creatures were intelligent, High Elf King Finian, of course, ordered them all executed. Only a few of the little rascals managed to escape into the jungle. A kuma is a type of bear. A Pocket Kuma is a different sort of creature, though they are distantly related. You take a small bear, crossbreed it with a capybara spirit, pick out the runt of the litter, and then breed it further down with a sugar glider. The resulting, bug-eyed creature is what you see before you now. They can’t fight for shit. They can barely walk. But holy shit are they disgustingly cute. I bet they smush really well.

The two of them speak with an eastern european accent.

Dmitri had just brought a [[cat]] named Capitan Whiskers.

Their game guide adviced Dmitri to select the [[nodling]] race that would give him an extra life if he'd died, he didn't realise that selecting it would force his brother into his body.

They took fatal damage during the fight against [[Imogen|Queen Imogen]] during the [[Butcher's Masquerade]] but instead of dying they were seperated and turned into babies. They were immediately transfered out of the dungeon as children are ineligible, it's implied their game guide got them to choice this option as they knew this would happen.

== Gear ==
Maxim has a meteroid hammer.

'''Dr. Porthus Hu''' is a former crawler and the author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]] (2nd Edition)''.  He is now CEO of the [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)]].

==Description==
A crawler in the 15th season of ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'', Porthus chose the High Elf race and Rogue class.  He received the first edition of the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]] disguised as a blank sketchbook after arriving on the ninth floor, and is the author of the second edition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition contained "meager, mostly-useless" recipes, which he did his best to add to before accepting a deal of 100 years of indentured servitude.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|4|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However many hundreds of cycles later, Dr. Porthus Hu is now CEO and President of Outreach Operations of the [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)|Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)]].   He insisted that OIPAN become Carl's second sponsor on the fifth floor, believing that he and Carl "fight the same fight."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|4|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He chose to send Carl the [[Toraline]], specially commissioned and approved the design of [[Carl's Xistera|Carl's Xistera Extension]], and sent the extension in an Emergency Platinum [[Sponsorship Box|Benefactor Box]] (which Mordecai suggests may be the most expensive box in the game's history).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cookbook Entries==

=== On Possession ===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Porthus, Second Edition.&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;''It’s important to note that possession via ghost and an evicted demon inhabiting a shell are two very, very different things. They call it possession, but it is anything but. Think of an elf falling to his death off a cliff, and at the last moment, he grabs onto a root, temporarily saving him. That root is the body he now resides within. Regular possession can be defeated. Evicted demons are something else entirely. Once one of these desperate creatures has taken a shell, be it living, dead, or recently undead, the end result for that shell is always the same. Destruction. They are gone the moment the demon moves in.''&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;''Kill it with fire. Destroy the head. Do whatever you can. These beasts will be frantic to get back home, and they will fight with everything they have. Don’t let one grab onto you, as it will pull you into Hades. Be wary of using healing magic on demon-possessed shells. While that works well for undead, it is different when it comes to those from the realm of Sheol. It is unpredictable and can possibly make the creature stronger.'' 

&lt;p&gt;''This is important. Do not. Do not, do not, do not. &lt;u&gt;Do not&lt;/u&gt; under any circumstances attempt to teleport a shell that’s possessed by an evicted demon away from you. The shell will teleport and dissipate.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''The Eye of the Bedlam Bride'' (chapter 55; p. 523). &lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Final Entry ===
&lt;Note added by Crawler Porthus, 2nd Edition&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''I don’t know why this journal came to me, but I don’t feel it will ever be enough. I have done my best, adding little things here and there to the meager, mostly-useless recipes. How many generations before this book truly has enough information to make a difference? Too many, I fear. As the first to receive these words, and now, as the author of the second edition, I feel inadequate. I have not done enough.'' 

''I have decided to accept the deal. I don’t know what will become of me, but I swear on the name of all my fallen brothers and sisters, one day I will make them pay. It seems those who live outside our world can exist for thousands of years. I don’t know how this is possible, but if I survive my 100 seasons of servitude, I will do everything I can to end this horror. I don’t know if I have the strength, but I will do my best to not be broken.'' 

''This will be my last entry into this book, but I am not yet done with the enemy. As long as I have breath, I will fight.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
You beat a quest before I could even give it to you! Anticipating what's going to happen is one thing, but this is just ridiculous. It's like arriving in your pants before your date can even untie their shoelaces.

Pathetic.

''Reward:'' You get nothing! And you would've received a good quest box, too!

Prepotente was a Boer goat pet when entered the dungeon with [[Miriam Dom]] and 14 other goats. On the Third Floor, he is changed by a enhanced pet biscuit.

He speaks with a posh british accent and occasionally emits a short high pitch scream. Affectionally called "Pony" by Miriam, he has a frenemy relationship with [[Carl]].

He attempts to kill [[Quan Ch]] at the end of [[Fourth Floor|The Iron Tangle]] Floor. On the [[Sixth Floor|sixth floor]] he managed to kill 10 [[Odious Creepers]] and 15 hunters.

He breaks the 7th Level, sending all the crawlers to the 8th Floor before the level even starts, angering the kua-tin engineer [[Cascadia]].

== Gear ==

* [[Enchanted Night Wyrm’s Ring of Divine Suffering|Ring of Divine Suffering]] (which he ate)
* A wand that can create a safe space that last for three minuets
* A magical spray applicator for spraying herbicide on plants

== Description ==
Author of the 14th edition of [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]]. 

He made it to the ninth floor. His mind broke while marching into Larracos conscripted into the [[Bugbear]] army, over the corpses of the NPCs, to be slaughtered by the orcs.

== Cookbook Entries ==
Larracos is like a dream. It is a living, breathing poem. A song. One that marks itself indelibly onto your bones the moment you experience it the first time. I've never seen anything like it. It's an inverted funnel of museums and galleries and colleges and of color. The NPCs live here. They have purpose and life. For the first time since we have been dragged into this horror, I feel awe and wonder and something other than rage. But it is a tainted and fleeting feeling. This city should not be here. It is too beautiful to be used in such a terrible, senseless way. I still don't fully understand the fable with the volcano and the centipede at the bottom and what sort of metaphor, if any, it's supposed to represent, but whoever designed this wonder at the center of the ninth floor was someone who appreciates fine detail and the art of turning the mundane into visual music. It is too beautiful, too real not to be a copy of someplace that truly existed, and it is difficult for my mind to make sense of it. For the first time, I don't know where the real ends and the nightmare begins, and it has taken my breath away. The Semeru dwarves supposedly built it, but they don't control the city. Not anymore. They're still around, mostly in the pubs. They're also the non-combatant caretakers of the inverted castle, which sits in the center of the city at the bottom of the well. The diameter of Larracos isn't that great. It's smaller than some of the cities in [[Sixth Floor|The Hunting Grounds]]. But the city itself has layers, going deeper and deeper, like an inverted cone. I believe that legend is what this city represents. The Semeru were attempting to reach the Celestials who live not above, but below them. This action somehow awakened Scolopendra at the very base of the volcano. This city thrives. Each level is something new and exciting. There are districts. One with theaters. Museums. Colleges filled with bright-eyed NPC students. Temples. Stores. Tonight, before we are expelled, I plan on sitting down and enjoying a play. A play, in this place. Can you believe it? I will draw a map for you. The one [[Milk]] drew is good, but it lacks detail. The alien beasts congregate in the pleasure districts. I don't dare venture down there, lest my impression of this fantasy is tainted. It's where they hire their mercenaries, though I hear those markets are already bled dry. It's where they trade their wares and buy their weapons from the murderers who cleaved through us like chaff on that nightmare of a [[Sixth Floor|sixth floor]]. The aliens get expelled when we do. Less than thirty hours until the fighting begins. They'll be back. Once only three armies remain, they'll be able to re-enter the city, and it will be destroyed. They say by the time the fighting is over, none of these NPCs are left alive. None of these building stand. It is all destroyed in the pursuit of an imaginary prize. This makes my heart hurt. This volcano world is obviously a fairy tale. But is this city real? It looks real. It smells real. There is history here. And if so, what's the purpose of giving this to us? To show us a wonder that once existed, to remind us that they don't care what they destroy? To beat us into further submission? And what of the NPCs? What of their suffering? I fear what will happen to my mind when I see it destroyed. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stab, stab, stab. It is all I know. It is the final days of [[Ninth Floor|Faction Wars]], and it is clear the [[Orc|orcs]] will stand victorious. It is clear the army I have been conscripted into will fall against these beasts. It is clear tomorrow I will die. The brutality and sadism of [[the Skull Empire]] is unparalleled. How is it these monsters are only play-acting? How can their citizens see this and not rise up after learning what lives in their leaders' hearts? I will soon be facing them on the battlefield. Tomorrow morning the bugbears march. Several of the enslaved, conscript crawlers in my squad will flee in the night and hide in the forest, but I'm afraid they will be run down, just like the others. Stab, stab, stab. I don't want to go back into the city. That beautiful dream. That song of a place. I am terrified. My mind is slipping. That beautiful city, destroyed? I cannot march with my eyes closed. The orcs have the numbers and the brutality, and the bugbears do nothing but laugh. I overheard one of them wondering out loud if the gods themselves will notice the battle, the bloodbath. That happens here, in this place. The gods notice when the toll is too great. They add themselves to the  fray. It is proof to me that in reality we are truly alone. My people are gone. There are only 300 of us left, down from millions. And they, the real gods, have not intervened? No. No. It's undeniable proof of our solitude. Stab. Stab. Stab. I hope there is music, in the end. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|54}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

So much. So little. Stab, stab, stab. If I fall, if I stand. It matters not when the song is done. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==AI Description ==
'''For the first several seasons of [[Dungeon Crawler World|''Dungeon Crawler World'']], all contestants started off as Primals. Primals are blank slates. You will look the same as before. You will obtain all skills associated with your current race, with the following exceptions:'''

*'''-1 to all base stats'''
*'''All higher-tier skills are unlocked and are able to train to 20.'''

'''Choosing this race unlocks multiple exclusive earth-based classes.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|2}}

==History==
The primals are the progenitors, the first known species to conquer the universe. Nobody knowns what they look like or what happened to them except that at one point there was a great war that spanned the galaxy.

When someone comes across an abandoned remnant of their civilization the resident AI if it is still sane usually takes the form of the race of the species that discovered it. That's why they take the appearance of whoever chooses them.

Princess D'Nadia is a character outside the dungeon. Her first appearance is in Book 2. She is of the [[Saccathian]] race. She is princess of the [[Prism]]. Her Prism kingdom is small but Princess D'Nadia is a powerful force in trade circles and is quite outspoken. She is described as a squid-like, or like a human sized Cthulu. Her skin appears gray and covered in bumps, with a tangle of squid-like tentacles hanging from her face. 

Carl and Donut meet her on a roundtable show with [[Ripper Wonton]]. She becomes Princess Donut's sponsor during the 4th floor. She gifts Donut a [[Benefactor Box|benefactor box]] containing her glasses ([[Prism Industries Capacitating and Focusing Goggles]]). She sends Donut another benefactor box on the 5th floor that upgrades the goggles. She is next seen judging the Pet Beauty Contest and Talent Show at the [[Butcher's Masquerade]]. She informs Donut that her father passed away and she is now Empress D'Nadia. At the end of the Butcher's Masquerade, Carl learns that Empress D'Nadia has purchased a spot for [[Ninth Floor|faction wars]]. She ended her sponsorship of Donut on the [[Eighth Floor|8th Floor (Ghosts of Earth)]].

Prism Industries Capacitating and Focusing Goggles. Special High-Fashion Edition. "The Princess Donut." These sunglasses were a gift to [[Donut]] in a Benefactor Box from her sponsor Princess D’Nadia on floor 4.

== AI Description ==
This is a Unique Item.

This one-of-a-kind item was a gift from Princess D’Nadia of the Prism Kingdom to Princess Donut of the Blood Sultanate. It was personally signed by Princess D’Nadia.

Protects the eyes from a variety of environmental hazards, including magic-based attacks that render the user blind. Enhances all dark vision effects. Allows for heat vision and other visible-light viewing options.

In addition, any energy-based spell that originates from the ocular region is caught and focused by these goggles, which allows for multiple combat and targeting options.

== Description ==
Large round sunglasses without arms that magically affix themselves to Donut's face. They have a movie-star style appearance and look similar to the pair of sunglasses Bea wears. They turn Donut's [[Magic Missile]] into a laser and allow her to manipulate the power of the spell. She can split her shots into as many as four beams, and she can store the energy of one cast and combine it with another.

== Upgrades ==
These were updated with a Benefactor Box from Princess D’Nadia on floor 5 to allow her to see temperature in more detail. In particular it shows her surface and internal temperature of things she looks at, which helped her to identify changelings masquerading as other people. In theory the glasses can be configured to give alerts when certain temperature conditions are met, which could help her spot mob weaknesses or hidden doors. Donut has little patience for that kind of detail, though, so as of the end of floor 5 Carl and Katia are still working with her to take full advantage of them.

}}
[[File:00386x.jpg|thumb|The Prize Carousel]]

'''The Prize Carousel''' is a time-restricted Dungeon minigame hosted by [[Chaco]].  Crawlers can receive the ability to "play" if their fans select it as a [[Fan Box]] reward, but it is not particularly popular and only happens a few times each season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref|3|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Heralded by colored lights and cheesy 1970s game show music, the Prize Carousel is a spinning, twinkling carousel that appears in the crawler's safe room after the Fan Box is opened.  It has nine curtained-off sections containing nine prizes.

The crawler has ten minutes to select a prize, but is not able to scan the items or view tooltip descriptions of the items. 


== Carl's Experience ==
Carl receives this prize from a Platinum Fan Box on the [[Fourth Floor | fourth floor]], and suspects that his fans voted for it specifically because of [[Mordecai]] and Chaco's strained relationship.

The people in this audience don’t care who is fighting who, as long as one of them ends up a crumpled, bloody heap on the mat before the night is done. Prizefighters don’t do it for the glory, or for honor. They do it to put food on the table. It’s nothing personal.

Prizefighters receive the following benefits:

* +5 to Constitution
* +2 to Strength.
* -2 to Intelligence
* -2 to Charisma
* +3 to the [[Pugilism Skill]]
* +1 to the Unarmed Combat Skill
* +1 to the [[Iron Punch|Iron Punch Skill]]
* +5 to the Knockout Skill
* +(1 x Floor Number) gold for every mob killed with a punch.
* Unlocks higher-tier Pugilism Skill benefit 

This is an Earth Class. As an incentive to choose an Earth Class, you will receive a Silver Earth Box upon choosing this class.

==AI Description==
Picture yourself in high school. Now picture all the girls who would never get anywhere near you. It’s kind of like that, but on purpose.

'''Cost''': This is an item-based spell. This spell does not require mana to cast. If you unequip the associated item, you will lose access to this spell. The cooldown will not reset.

'''Target''': a 3-meter radius sphere centered around the right hand of caster + 50 centimeters of radius per level of Intelligence. (Current radius: 4.5 meters)

'''Duration''': 5 seconds + 1 second per level of spell. (Current Duration: 20 seconds.) Requires 30-hour cooldown.

A favorite of frontline tanks and castle guards, the expensive and rare Protective Shell spell shields the caster and anyone within the sphere from a mob’s physical presence or physical attacks. This spell does not protect against magic or against non-corporeal entities. Unlike the more popular Shield spell, this spell does not move with you. This spell’s area of effect remains static once cast, unimpeded by your physical surroundings. So if you use this spell only when you really, really need it, you’re probably only delaying the inevitable by a few seconds.

Puddle Jumper is a teleportation spell obtained by [[Donut]] on [[Dungeon Floor 1|Floor 1]].

== Description ==
'''Cost''': 20 mana

'''Target''': surface within line of sight (total distance limited by spell level)

'''Duration''': Instant teleportation after a casting delay of 10 seconds

'''Cooldown''': 5 hours

Allows the caster and up to three others to teleport onto a surface within line of sight. The maximum allowable teleport distance increases with spell level, but the exact allowable distance is hidden. If the caster tries to teleport to a location that's too far way the spell will fail to cast. Because of the delay and five-hour cooldown it is not a practical spell for combat. Makes a popping sound when the teleport happens.

'''Level 5 Upgrade''': Casting delay is reduced to 2 seconds. Direct line of sight to the landing surface no longer required, allowing for teleportation to higher elevations.

He specifically tells Carl that he does not represent Donut or Katia or anyone else.

Wears a tie with a Nullian hula girl on it, he later changed it to one covered in pickles wearing sunglasses.

He helped Carl negotiate a deal with [[Orren|Orran]] to hand over the [[The Gate of the Feral Gods|Gate of the Feral Gods]] in exchange for extra security and additional spells.

"He was a gray alien. I knew from reading the descriptions in the cookbook what this creature was. A Nullian, though they were mostly just called "the Null." I'd seen their kind once or twice in talk show audiences, but the seemed rare. This race was similar to the much-taller Forsoother, but this guy was only about four and a half feet tall. He looked just like a stereotypical, cartoon, Area-51 alien with the gray skin, large eyes, and the bulbous head. He wore a tan suit with a tie. The tie had what appeared to be an image of a Nullian hula gurl on it. The hula girl gyrated back and forth."

An extreamly powerful mob, it's later implied that they explode when you kill them.

According to [[Mordecai]] they are always under the effect of the [[Bitch, What?|Fire Berserker]] spell.

==AI Description==
{{Character_info|level=93|skills=[[Reverse Gravity]]}}
The first recorded summoning of a Rage Elemental, blah, blah, blah. If you are reading this, you likely don’t give a shit about the monster’s (rather interesting and tragic) history. You’re probably running. It’s not going to matter. The almost-indestructible Rage Elemental is said to only dissipate after it has claimed 666 souls.

In other words, you are fucked. Absolutely, bite-the-pillow, fucked.

== AI Description ==
'''Frenzied Gerbil Level 11 Neighborhood Boss!'''

Before we send you off to certain death, it’s time for a short history lesson.

When the Black Death swept through 14th century Europe, killing upwards of 200 million people and forever altering the course of human history, one of the original culprits of the epidemic was said to be the black rat, carrying plague-infested fleas into population centers to wreak their destruction.

This is, in fact, not true. The true perpetrator was actually the Asian great gerbil, who took advantage of the warmer climate to travel the silk road and bring the disease into Europe.

This is only important to know because Ralph, champion pit fighter of the kobold training grounds, lives his life in a perpetual state of rage. Why? Because he feels that human death toll of 200 million is much too low, and he will do everything in his power to triple that number.

Starting with you.

The only survivor of a family of gerbils left to starve by a child who’d grown bored with the pets, Ralph had to commit unspeakable acts of cannibalism in order to endure.

Part earth rodent, part the embodiment of death, Frenzied Gerbils are regular mobs one might encounter on the fifth or seventh floors. But Ralph here is special. He has dedicated his existence to fighting and training in hopes that one day he might exact his revenge against the humans he so despises.

He is fast, he is angry, and by the time you’re done reading this, he’s already halfway to your jugular.

You might want to duck.

'''New Quest! The Recital.'''

Dinosaur attacks are becoming more and more of a problem in the large settlement of Point Mongo. It started small. A chicken here. An [[Ursine]] there. People didn't care so much at first since they were mostly picking off the annoying people. But the attacks are getting worse. The dinosaurs probing the town's defenses are getting bigger. There's plenty of easier-to-obtain dino chow out in the jungle, so what is causing all of this attention on Point Mongo? Why are they attacking?

Exterminate the threat. Or, find out what they want, and then give it to them. I'll leave it up to you.

'''''Reward''''': You will receive a [[Quest Box|Gold Quest Box]]! You will also receive a free town upgrade!

{{Character_info|species=Skyfowl
Soul leach capacitor|status=Deceased|level=1}}

In this iteration of the Dungeon, Remex is the first husband of [[Miss Quill]].

He calls himself a "tenner", implying he made it to the tenth floor. He also tells Carl it is a good thing to die on floor three and not go further down.

Later Carl learned that Remex was an infamous user of the [[Zerzura]] Spell, using the spell to transport this army down each floor with him. This strategy ultimately lead to his ruin when it unexpectedly moved his army from the sixth to the ninth floor. Afterwards he devoted himself to trying to free his son, the exit deal he made was so impressive it was studied by legal students.

He was killed by an orc years ago. He was turned into a level one Soul Leach Capacitor by [[Miss Quill]] after dying, became a bereft minion after Quill died. In life he was a dark cleric.

:'''System Message. Posting Book 7 spoilers will result in "acceleration" per [[Dungeon Crawler Carl Wiki:Wiki rules | this wiki's rules]].'''

Residuals exist in every intelligent civilisation with a [[primal engine]]. They are a collective mind that attempt to sneak into the crawl and tell the [[System AI|AI]] how to speak to it’s ancestors. When in the dungeon monsters don't attack them until they've passed on their knowledge. They have to wait until the AI has to have gone primal or the information is automatically filtered out.

The syndicate attempted to deal with them by exterminate them, then they attempted to hide the location of the crawl so they couldn't interfer, neither approach worked.

They currently split into two factions that are now at war with each other, one of these factions has left the collective and wants to exterminate all life in the galaxy.

All the Residuals we've meet so far have been [[Gondii]] or have used [[Valtay]] technology.

== Known Residuals ==

* [[Agatha]]
* [[Paulie]]
* [[Alexandro]]

'''Type''': Accelerant.

'''Effect''': Highly flammable liquid. Explosive fumes.

'''Status''': Will not activate until introduced to flame.

'''Description:''' At 180 proof, this moonshine will take the hair off your chest and then put it back on. The Rev-Up version is distilled using two types of sugars: the slime trails left behind by the passage of the Brindle Grub, and a secretive, proprietary source. Created exclusively on the dungeon’s second floor by the Rev-Up company, jugs of this concoction are highly sought after by the drinking establishments that populate the third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, and eighteenth floors. Drinking a swig (defined as 1.5 ounces) of this “potion” will immediately cause you to gain the Shit-Faced debuff, has a 50% chance to render you Blind for a period of 30 hours, a 5% chance to immediately kill you, and a 45% chance to permanently raise a random stat by two points.

The proprietary source comes from [[Krakaren Clone|Krakaren Clones]]. Rev-Up Moonshine is used as an ingredient in [[Carl's Jug O'Boom]].

{{citation}}
An addictive species specific opioid produced by the Krakaren. Used to keep the mobs of the [[Fourth Floor|Iron Tangle]] in order.

One of the side effects of the Rev-Up Vitamin Shot is the possibility of addiction, if customers get addicted and fail to get their shot they start experiencing the effects of withdraw, if not treated in time they begin to suffer from a dreaded condition known as the DTs.

'''Stage one''' – suffers are overcome with violent terror, their mind starting to rot out from within, only 50% of suffers survive this stag, half move on to stag two which allows for increased mobility, the other half die transforming into a festering ghoul. Festering ghouls have two objects, to devour as much organic material as possible and find more of their kind.

Ringmaster Grimaldi is a level 85 City Boss [[Elite]] that Carl met on the third floor.

Redstone Grimaldi was originally a dwarf and husband to [[Tsarina Signet]]. He was the ringmaster of the 'great and wonderful Grimaldi's Traveling Circus' before he was transformed to a Pestiferous Vine by the poison cloud of the cataclysm. 
==Appearance==
More like a giant bush or shrub than a vine in appearance, taking up the entirety of the center ring and reaching the ceiling of the tent, swallowing the pole.
==AI Description==
Ringmaster Grimaldi - Pestiferous Vine 

This is an Elite. 

Level 85 City Boss! 

Before the cataclysm, if you asked any child of the sprawling Over City what their favorite activity was, a good number of them would happily tell you of the great and wonderful Grimaldi's Traveling Circus. Children dreamed of walking outside and seeing the long line of circus carts rumbling through the streets, of the tents being erected in their local park. Circus night was a holiday. A time of joy. 

To Redstone Grimaldi, nothing was more important than his family. He loved each and every one of them. When the cataclysm came, and the poison cloud swept over the circus, he was center stage. He remains there to this day. 

Transformed from a simple dwarf to a hulking Pestiferous Vine, Grimaldi uses his special powers to keep his family safe and alive. No matter how many times they die, no matter how many crawlers the clowns devour, he brings them back, memories intact. Well, mostly intact. Somewhere in there Grimaldi may be aware that this may not be the most moral of choices. But that's what we do when it comes to family. We protect them at all costs. 

And besides, you know what they say.

The show must go on.

== AI Description ==
This amber-stoned ring is named after Rockard, one of the dungeon’s most infamous crawlers. This orcish warrior was known for his uncanny ability to swoop in at the last moment and steal glory from other crawlers, gaining the best loot and experience. Everybody hated him. It was great!

Fun fact. This guy led his season’s top 10 list until he was knifed in his sleep by his own mother. Luckily for you, crawlers can’t be killed by other crawlers in saferooms anymore. A shame, really.

Wearing this ring imbues the following benefits:

* '''The Ripe Benefit''': All creatures with less than 50% health are indicated on your map. This does not increase your map’s view, but used in conjunction with other skills such as Pathfinder, it makes being a glory-stealing asshole really easy”
* '''The Loaded benefit:''' All non-hidden creatures wearing magical gear are indicated on your map. Particularly useful when you only want to hang out with the real fashionistas and not just the posers wearing fake shit. Also good if you want to sneak up behind someone, bonk them on their head, and steal all their stuff.”

[[File:Rory 500px.png|thumb]]
In case you’re wondering, Shamanka is just a fancy way of saying female shaman. Goblin Shamans are the leader class of all goblin clans, second only to the War Chieftain or, more rarely, the Goblin Warlord. They are without humor and are said, as part of their training, to have to pick two of the following three actions in order to graduate Shamanka University: they have to fuck, cook, and/or eat their own parents. Most don’t pick cook. And if that wasn’t messed up enough, they specialize in Anguish Magic, a dark magic school designed to focus and enhance damage from other attacks.

{{Character_info|species=[[Crest]]|status=Alive|title1=Rosetta Thagra|first_appearance=Chapter 13, Book 3|image1=01046.png}}
== Description ==
A former crawler, Rosetta is the host of a talk show called ''[[Shadow Boxer]]''. Immediately after escaping the dungeon, she made a documentary about her home world named "The Other Side of the Glass". After that, ''Shadow Boxer'' was funded by the [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC)|Open Intellect Pacifist Network]].

Author of the 9th edition of [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]] and wrote down dozens of explosives recipes in it.

== Appearance ==
She appears as a pale, pretty human in her early twenties with pale skin and a long flowery tattoo on her right leg.

== Cookbook Entries ==
Comrades, you know the high-level madness satchels, the bronze tier ones with the big yield? They are not as useless as they look. Because they randomly fall into rapid de-stability and explode, they are most dangerous unless they are in your inventory, of course. But with the 15-second waiting period after removing it, it makes them almost impossible to use because they can (and do) explode during those fifteen seconds. I have discovered a solution. If you can find or build an equippable backpack, they will not lose stability as long as they are in the backpack and the backpack is equipped. This also works for other party members if you wish to give them explosives to utilize. Use with caution. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Never trust mercenaries. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

How can they do this? Do they not see us? Are we not real to them? We are the same. By the gods old and new, we are the same. Yet they kill us like we are nothing. Comrades, if I ever get out of this, which seems more and more unlikely by the day, I swear upon the moons I will spend the rest of my days making certain this evil is not only eradicated from the stars, but there will be accountability for their crimes. I swear it, I swear it, I swear it. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comrade, I agree. One day, we will make certain they all know. Our words will not be lost. I swear it. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As fragile as they look, fairies and sprites can be difficult to kill. They're fast. They're magical. They're always on alert. They say luck is not a real stat in this place, but I think it is. The luck of these little monsters... it's unnatural. Something crazy always happens when I try to fight one. Be wary, comrades. But if you must fight them, pulls their wings off. They come off easily. That's where they store their magic. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only way for a crawler to move from one floor to the next is via a stairwell. That's it. It is an unbreakable rule. There is no skipping floors. At the end of [[Ninth Floor|Faction Wars]], after the viceroys pulled out their last minute victory, a portal appeared, and several of the remaining fucks stepped within. It was all of them. The orcs, the viceroys, the operatics, even the nagas, all together, laughing as if they weren't just bathing in each other's entrails the day before. It appeared it was taking them to another part of the dungeon. Some sort of nightclub on a different floor for a victory party. They dragged several unwilling NPCs with them, including the librarian elves from the college, whose help was instrumental in our survival. A crawler tried to jump through the portal to save the NPCs, and he was stopped like it was a wall of glass. He tried casting a spell through the portal, but it did not work, though the attempt did catch the attention of the orc prince. The orc stepped back through the glass into the smoldering remains of Larracos, lassoed the crawler, and returned to the portal. The rope pulled itself within, and it cut the crawler in half. We watched as the orc and his friends laughed, just there on the other side of the glass. It was the last crawler they killed, of the thousands who fell during that pointless game. Tonight, I will dream of watching them burn. Tonight, I will pretend I was smart enough to find a way to lance them from afar. Comrades, I hope you help me realize my dream one day. &lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AI Description (1) ==
Ruckus. Spring-operated Chicken Hawk Sentinel. Level 55 Borough Boss! This is a bereft minion of Shamus Chaindrive.

The great bugbear treasure hunter Shamus Chaindrive was known as both a paranoid and a greedy bastard. Having been betrayed one too many times, he no longer trusted any living soul. That is why his crew was always comprised of constructs and automatons.

He dedicated his life to hunting down long-lost treasures and artifacts. He prized one item above all others.

[[The Gate of the Feral Gods]]. Said to be buried in the long-lost Necropolis of Anser.

Chaindrive set out to find the tomb. He boarded his great submarine and sank beneath the waves, vowing to never surface again until he had his prize.

It took the bugbear almost twenty years to find the tomb, poking up like a monolith from a desert island. Using his submarine, he docked it against an underwater entrance directly adjacent to the main chamber of the trap-filled tomb. He quickly learned that he was not the first to arrive. A young mage had recently landed on the island and was attempting to magically burrow into the tomb. A colony of dirigible gnomes were settled in the area. All sought the treasures held within the tomb. All had failed so far.

Chaindrive unleashed his greatest weapon in an attempt to slow the efforts of his competitors. Ruckus had been stored in stasis in the hold of his great submarine. The self-replicating, spring-operated automaton was given the task to kill all who wished to steal Chaindrive's prize.

Now that the bugbear is long dead, the sentinel chicken hawk is content to  spend its day circling around the island and being an all-around asshole. The regular residents of the island are smart enough to leave this powerful boss alone. The fact you're reading this means you're not one of the smart ones.

== AI Description (2) ==
Ruckus. Spring-operated Chicken Hawk Sentinel. Level 55 Borough Boss!

It's a bird! It's a landscaping tool! It's a goddmaned death robot!

Ol' Ruckus is a left-over anti-boat, anti-everything else security and scout automaton that has lost contact with the ''Akula''. Lost contact, that is, until now. Having awakened and been given new orders, it is now seeking out enemies of the captain.

And you, my soon-to-be-buzzsawed-to-death-friends, are enemies of the [[Maggie My|captain]].

Samantha, also called Psamathe, is a minor deity of unrequited love that got tossed into the Nothing. The [[The Royal Court of Princess Donut|Royal Court]] met her on the 5th floor possessing the severed head of a half-naiad sex doll named [[Lika]].

She is in love with an unnamed king and has a [[Mrs. Ghazi|sand ooze]] child that she says is now on the ninth floor.

[[Emberus]] is her great uncle and cousin. [[Tsarina Signet]] is her third cousin twice removed by marriage.

Samantha’s mother is a huge, multiple arms goddess, she is sleeping with the same king as Samantha.

==AI Description==
'''Lika Love Doll Head'''

This item is possessed with the Withering Spirit of Psamathe.

Psamathe, or Samantha as her friends used to call her, is a minor deity who was banished to the Nothing by her father after he found out she was kicking around with some ancient king guy. She’s usually accompanied by her trusty sidekick, a sand ooze familiar who also happens to be the cursed child of her union with the king. You know, typical god stuff.

''And if you think that’s peculiar, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Those guys hanging out in the halls of the Celestial Ascendency on the 12th floor get themselves involved in some serious whackadoodle business, let me tell you. You ever see a guy give birth to a fortune-telling, snake-headed cow out of his thigh? Or a woman whose menstrual blood is sentient? That’s the sort of shit that’s waiting for you down there.''

Psamathe is as intelligent as she is quick-tempered. Unfortunately for her, her first escape attempt from the Nothing resulted in a split, and half of her essence was forced to take refuge in the closest unoccupied naiad vessel she could find, which happened to be a sex doll based on the fictional Lika, who, oddly enough, was actually based loosely on an inaccurate history of Psamathe. She’s had to live in the doll for many years, unable to move until the rest of her spirit could be reunited.

The story gets kind of weird from there.

'''Santería''' (Spanish pronunciation: [san̪.t̪eˈɾi.a]), is a religion that developed in Cuba during the late 19th century. 

Practitioners venerate the ''oricha'' at altars, either in the home or in the ''casa'' (temple), which is run by a ''santero'' (priest) or ''santera'' (priestess).

[[File:00886.jpg|thumb|This is a depiction of Scolapendra. She's dreaming. It's said when she finally awakens, she will destroy everything and free us all.]]

== Books 1-3 ==
Scolopendra is first mentioned by name in [[Carl's Doomsday Scenario (Book)|book 2]] during the [[Vengeance of the Daughter]] quest. [[System AI|The AI]], describing [[Mold Lion|the mold lions]] at [[Ringmaster Grimaldi|Grimaldi’s]] Circus, mentions the great cataclysm which resulted in many transformations and names Scolopendra as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Mordecai]] previously refered to this event, describing Scolopendra only as "a great monster" who, in a children's story common in the universe, lived at the bottom of a giant dormant volcano. The volcano contained a six layered magical world but, one day, the great monster killed or transformed 90% of those living in this world by breathing out a poison gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{Quote
| quote = Scolopendra's poison cloud was a Nine Tier attack. It attacked you in nine different ways. The lucky ones simply died. The others were transformed, all in different ways.
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;small&gt;[[Tsarina Signet]] (Book 2, Chapter 8)&lt;/small&gt;
}}

In [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Book)|book 3]] the [[System AI]] refers to the [[Third Floor|3rd]], [[Sixth Floor|6th]], [[Ninth Floor|9th]], [[Twefth Floor|12th]], [[Fifteenth Floor|15th]], and [[Eighteenth Floor|18th]] floors as "The Scolopendra Lair" levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Book 4 ==

In [[The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book)|book 4]] we discover that [[Ghazi]] left the [[Larracos College of Magecraft]] to seek the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]] because he had been fooled into releasing [[Samantha|Psamathe]] from the nothing. The College told him to use the [[Mysterious Winding Box]] to banish himself and [[Samantha|Psamathe]] back into the nothing. [[Ghazi|Ghazi's]] ex-girlfriend [[Tish]] tells him that Scolopendra will never be defeated now as the college needed "that artifact".&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Later in [[The Gate of the Feral Gods (Book)|book 4]] we have some speculation from [[Priestly]], Author of the 14th edition of [[The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]], in relation to the city of [[Larracos]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I still don't fully understand the fable with the volcano and the centipede at the bottom... My culture has a story of a people who built a tower to reach the gods before the gods struck it down and scattered them all. I believe that legend is what this city represents.&lt;br&gt; 
The [[Semeru Dwarf|Semeru]] were attempting to reach the [[twelfth floor|Celestials]] who live not above, but below them. This action somehow awakened Scolopendra at the very base of the volcano" -- &lt;small&gt;[[Priestly|Crawler Priestly]] (Book 4, Chapter 33)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Book 5 ==
Early in [[The Butcher's Masquerade (Book)|Book 5]] we have a passage from [[Forkith]], Author of the 20th edition of [[The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]], in relation to [[Larracos]] and [[Sixth Floor|The hunting grounds]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This world, according to the story, was half metropolis and half jungle before Scolopendra's nine-tier attack,whatever that even means. After the attack, most everyone died, and the jungle ran rampant, swallowing the ruins. However, after a few hundrend years, the survivors have started to rebuild." -- &lt;small&gt;[[Forkith|Crawler Forkith]] (Book 5, Chapter 5)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[System AI]] mentions the nine-tier attack a few times in relation to surviving species such as [[Bugbear|bugbears]], [[Ursine]] and bush [[Elf|elves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; He also mentions that dinosaur-class monsters didn't exist in the area before the nine-tier attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; We later discover that the dinosaurs are transformed [[Ursine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Holger]] explains that those of his people who survived [[Imogen|Queen Imogen's]] attack were mostly unaffected by the Nine Tier attack. He thinks this is because the Transfiguration spell making up one of the Tiers was the same one that [[Imogen]] had previously used on them. He describes two of the other tiers as spores and a rage spell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|5|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
When [[Carl]] asks how the high  [[Elf|elves]] coped with Scolopendra's attack, [[Clint Smashgrab|Clint]] explains that they hid in their castle, protected by something that they had stolen. He says that they stole [[Soul Crystals|soul gems]] from Scolopendra while she slept and that, as she was waking, they stole something else which protected them from her multi-attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
[[Holger]] then claims that [[Imogen]] tried to cast a Transfiguration spell on Scolopendra, that this didn't work, and that this is why the Nine Tier attack included a Transfiguration spell. He says it was like a damage reflect but one that took a long time to get ready. [[Clint Smashgrab|Clint]] disputes this saying that [[Imogen]] is old, but not that old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Another captured hunter, [[Iota]], tells [[Carl]] and [[Donut]] that the [[Eighteenth Floor|18th Floor]] is called "Club Scolopendra" and that "the assholes partying it up" there have private security in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Within the  [[Elf|elf]] castle [[Carl]] comments on a giant mosaic featuring a glittering black and gold cave dotted with sparkling crystals like the inside of a geode. In the center is a curled up black centipede whose form is continually twisting like a hypnotic spiral. From the center of the mosaic sprouts a white tree which Scolopendra appears to be trying to strangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
An unknown voice says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a depiction of Scolapendra. She's dreaming. It's said when she finally awakens, she will destroy everything and free us all." -- &lt;small&gt;Unknown (Book 5, Chapter 66)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A few chapters later [[Mordecai]] tells [[Carl]] more about [[Soul Crystals|soul crystals]] saying that they are mined from Scolopendra's lair after being created when certain types of people die and have their souls filtered through Scolopendra's body. [[Memorial Crystal|memorial crystals]], he says, are similar but are created fallen gods or demigods.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Near the end of the book it's revealed that [[Prepotente|Pony]] specifically wants the [[Memorial Crystal|memorial crystal]] to protect himself from Scolapendra's attacks so that he can defeat her.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

== Book 6 ==
In the introduction to [[The Eye of the Bedlam Bride (Book)|book 5]] [[Donut]] gives a recap which includes a claim that Scolapendra is the final boss of the [[Dungeon|dungeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Later the [[System AI]] talks about the [[The Reminiscence Hydra of Malicious Compliance]]. In the very early days of the [[Dungeon Crawler World]], larger versions of the Hydra were the final boss of the [[Dungeon]] and they were known as Scolapendra Nymphs. He then says that this name is not ''entirely'' accurate, heavily implying that it is ''somewhat'' accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

In a passage by [[Allister]], Author of the 13th edition of [[The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]], we discover more about [[Ysalte|Ysalte aka The Downward Spiral/The Inevitable/the Vinegar Bitch]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some say she is the reason for Scolopendra's nine-tier attack. I've heard one dwarf say she is the daughter of the great centipede. Another say she's the sister. Another claimed she's the mother. I doubt any of those are true." -- &lt;small&gt;[[Allister]] (Book 6, Chapter 64)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the closing passages of the book [[Donut]] realises that the glow she has been seeing from [[Upgrade Patch|The Scavenger’s Daughter]] patch when it's fully charged was not an aardvark as she had supposed&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|72}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's a giant dentipede! The image is of a centipede crawling through all the skulls! It's disgusting!" -- &lt;small&gt;[[Donut]] (Book 6, Chapter 72)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Speculation ==
It's likely that "the artifact" [[Tish]] said is needed to defeat Scolopendra is the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]].    

It's very likely that the "something else" the high elves stole, which protected them from the Nine Tier attack, would have been the [[Memorial Crystal]].

Warning: This item has a short shelf life.

Maybe it’s not as good as getting something new, but sometimes it’s better to just take something you’re already comfortable with and improve upon it. Kind of like buying your girl new tits.

Once you read this scroll, one, random, currently-equipped item will receive an upgrade. That upgrade could be small. It could be huge. But since this item has a short shelf life, you gotta do it now or forever hold your peace.

==Description==
'''Cost''': 10 mana

'''Target''': a dead corpse

'''Duration''': One minute per spell level. 

Allows the caster to turn a corpse into an undead minion for the duration of the spell. The dead creature must have been a lower level than the caster. As a minion, the undead creature can be targeted by minion spells like [[Clockwork Triplicate]] and will fight for the caster until the end of the spell. Once it runs out the minion turns back into a corpse.

'''Leve 5 Upgrade''': Duration increases to 2 minutes per spell level. Corpses from creatures up to 5 levels higher than the caster can be targeted.

'''The Second Floor''' is a [[Tutorial]] floor.  Similar to the [[First Floor]], it is a sprawling, grid-like network of passages and tunnels that look like they were hewn out of rock. The vast level is split into sections that are not connected, so crawlers originating in China cannot interact with crawlers from the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introductory Announcement==
[[Cascadia]] makes the introductory announcement after the final first floor recap episode airs, approximately six hours after the Second Floor opens.  The announcement mostly details the [[Borant Corporation | Borant Corporation's]] desperate cash-grab for money via sponsorship boxes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|31}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Hello crawlers.'' 
&lt;p&gt;''Welcome to the second floor. Congratulations to all of you. We have just under 1.3 million crawlers still in the game. That number is slightly lower than our projections, so we are speeding up the second floor timer to the minimum legally allowed by the rules. You have six days to find a staircase down. Once again, we urge you all to wait until the last possible moment to descend.''&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;''As soon as this announcement ends, you will find that follows and favorites will be turned on for our viewers. The numbers will populate slowly on your interface, so don’t be too disappointed if you don’t see anything just yet.''&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;''We have improved how patronage works this season. This is a major change, so please pay attention.''&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;''All crawlers are now limited to three patrons, and all three spots will be up for auction for one day immediately upon the induction of the fourth floor, then fifth, then sixth floors respectively. Your benefactors may so choose to transfer their patronage to other parties at their own discretion starting on the seventh floor.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''All patronage spots will become available at a bid of one credit, meaning this season virtually all living crawlers will have patrons.''&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;''But, be warned. Any bids the patron pays above the standard patronage fee will be reflected in loot box discounts for that patron. Any funds below the fee will be reflected in additional costs to that patron for loot boxes. In other words, the more your patron pays for you, the more and higher-quality Benefactor Boxes you may receive. The higher your social numbers, the better your chances at receiving the best loot. Your tutorial guide should have more details and will help you if you have any additional questions.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Finally, we must say we are disappointed in the disrespect we are being shown regarding the bathrooms. As of this moment, if any human-born crawler intentionally urinates or defecates anywhere outside a designated bathroom area, they will be immediately and swiftly penalized in the form of a Rage Elemental plucked from the 13th floor. This elemental will kill them and everyone in their party before they can get their pants back up.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''That’s it for tonight. Have fun out there, and remember to kill, kill, kill!''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. Dungeon Crawler Carl: A LitRPG/Gamelit Adventure (pp. 265-266). Dandy House. Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Special Floor Mechanics==
'''1.''' Crawlers who descended from the First Floor up to six hours before the First Floor collapsed were able to immediately access the Second Floor (less time spent appearing on televised programs).

'''2.''' Crawlers' [[Ratings]] begin populating after the first recap episode airs.  Crawlers can now be viewed at any time (except in the restroom) by anyone with tunnel access.  

'''3.''' Dungeon Bosses can now exit their rooms.

'''4.''' It is still free to rent a bedroom in a safe room.

'''5.''' Any crawlers in a designated safe room one hour before floor collapse will be teleported out of the safe room.

'''6.''' [[Brindle Grubs]] generate every time a corpse is created.

==Loot==
The first two floors are designed to load crawlers up with a variety of loot so that they can experiment with possible builds. By the time a crawler arrives on the third floor, they should have a good idea of what class and race will work for them.

On the second floor, low-tier [[Loot Boxes]] commonly contain torches and bandages. Mobs drop skins, organs, and other items that can be used in crafting later.

You know that feeling you get when you walk out into the world with minty-fresh breath? It’s like you can take on any challenge that is thrown your way. It gives you confidence. It boosts your self-esteem. It makes you feel like you’re on top of the damn world. 

Well, this stuff does none of that. However, if you brush your teeth using this enchanted, cherry-flavored toothpaste, you are imbued with the following buffs for 30 hours: 

+Three Times Damage to all Boss Monsters. 

or

+Four Times Damage to all Boss Monsters if the Boss is a Province, Country, or Floor Boss. 

This buff may only be applied in a safe room.

Used before the fight with [[Imogen|Queen Imogen]].

'''Cost''': Nothing. Requires to be in [[Emberus]]' good graces to cast.

'''Target''': Self Only

'''Duration''': Instantaneous. Fire burst lasts up to three seconds, which is complete overkill with this stuff.

'''Cooldown''': Once a day. Resets with the obeisance countdown.

Casts a non-static sphere of ''Sheol Fire'' around the caster with a 1-foot buffer from all body parts of caster. Fire expands in a distance of .15 meters level level until it reaches level 15, at which time the distance increases exponentially and may be controlled.

At level 10, the fire will expand in a sphere 1.5 meters around your body. That's up, down, left, and right. So you might want to be careful where you are when you cast this.

What is Sheol Fire? You know how when you were a kid, you'd take a lighter and pass your finger over the flame really fast, and it wouldn't hurt you? Don't try that with this stuff. It's fire with rabies. Wood instantly turns to ash. Rock to lava. Flesh... well. Just be careful. Or don't, if you're looking to go out with some char-scented gusto.

The seventh floor, it was designed by [[Cascadia]] and destroyed by [[Prepotente]]. The design is based of a Princess Rupert’s drop.

The level is inspired by a fairy tale of a boy stuck in a maze where every time he takes a tunnel it is sealed of behind him, he is presented with thousands of path but he keeps taking the incorrect one and killed. Afterwards he is resurrected by a god and forced to start over again.
==Introductory Announcement==
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;Hello, Crawlers!&lt;/small&gt;'' 

''&lt;small&gt;Welcome to the seventh floor! The countdown is on!&lt;/small&gt;'' 

''&lt;small&gt;Rules. The moment this message ends, each crawler pod will slide to the starting chute and open. This will happen in order. Once opened, you will be pulled through the tunnel and into the maze. All paths lead to the exit. There are no dead ends. The exit portals you see behind you are physically pulling you in, but in order to get to them, you must first negotiate the maze paths, which constitute several hundred kilometers of twisting and turning tubes. Each path leads to a node which in turn leads to multiple branches. In some cases, there are literally hundreds of possible paths. Pitstop saferooms exist in these nodes. You cannot backtrack. Some paths are more dangerous than others. Some require the solving of math equations or puzzles to proceed. All tunnels are passable. The danger level of each branch is marked, oftentimes describing what you’ll find along the way and the distance to the next node. Most major nodes contain a zero tube, or a path with no danger. You must choose your path. Once a path has been passed through by 10 crawlers or a single party, it closes for an amount of time based on difficulty. All zero tubes may only be passed once. So those of you in the back might want...&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It allows bards to sing a song they normally couldn’t, the system helped them perform if they had the music in front of them making it easier to pull off but with a chance of failure if the performance was out of key. If sung badly it tears a little bit, to many tears and it’s ruined. If sung perfectly and in the correct pitch the spell is added to your bard repertoire, when this happens the sheet music isn’t consumed and can be sold or given to someone else.

==Description==
Author of the 15th Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
A level 3 sapper's table lets you infuse bombs. Soak a hobgoblin smoke curtain in a healing potion, let it dry, and it mass kills undead like you wouldn't believe. (Chapter 8, Book 3)

I now worship the goddess [[Kuraokami]]. Worst decision ever. The goddess is sponsored by some male soother twat who is treating it like I really worship ''him''. They made this whole system more complicated than it needs to be. If you see a god or if you find a temple or if you find a scroll of prayer, you're given the option to worship a god. Once you do it, there's a pawful of benefits but also a bunch of rules you gotta follow. For Kuraokami, if you kill something, you have to touch the corpse with ice at least once a day. Why? Who the fuck knows. I don't have an ice spell, so I need to go back to safe rooms and get more ice every day. If I do the ice thing once a day five days in a row, I get a boon. Only you don't know what the boon is going to be. I haven't made it five days yet. If you miss a day, the goddess "turns her back," and you stop getting any of the benefits. If you miss two days, you receive a debuff. If you miss three, you fall from grace and can't worship them anymore. There's a 50% chance you'll get "smited." I don't know what that means, but it ain't gonna be good. You can also voluntarily leave the faith, but it comes with an automatic smite. But worst of all, while you worship the god, the god can sometimes send you messages. The description says it's rare, but my goddess won't shut the hell up. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who worships her, and this rat asshole is bored or something and sends me message after message. The last note I got was, "You need to say I'm the prettiest goddess out loud." I finally told him to fuck off. But now the twat is swearing at me in my messages. I don't know if they have any real power over me unless he somehow gets summoned or I get smote. As soon as I get to a stairwell station, I'm going to leave the faith and jump down the stairs. Maybe that'll save me. (Chapter 30, Book 4)

==Introductory Announcement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;Hello, Crawlers!&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;Welcome to the sixth floor! We are so happy to have you here!&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;Like the third floor, this sixth floor is a Dungeon Crawler World tradition! It’s the hunting grounds! This floor is almost identical in layout and size to the third floor, but the abandoned ruins have been claimed by hundreds of years of foliage. What secrets and mysteries lay hidden in the jungle? You’ll have 17 days to find out! But this time, you won’t be alone.&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;We currently have 360 hunters on deck, and they’re raring to go. In a little less than 28 hours, they will be unleashed and will begin hunting you for your gear. Due to recent events, we are keeping registration open until the very last moment, and we expect that number of participants to double or even triple by the time they are released! But be warned! Some of these hunters have been here for weeks now, and even though they’re currently sequestered, their minions and traps are still out there and waiting for you. A few of you have already found this out the hard way!&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;Traditionally, all hunters start out at level 30 and are able to train themselves up as you make your way through the lower floors. It’s no secret that you’re here sooner than usual. In the spirit of fairness and as an incentive to gain more last-minute participants, we have given all hunters a bump of 20 levels, so they all start out at 50.&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;We’ll have more information about the hunt after the next recap message, but I wanted to thank you all for your participation. I know that last floor was tough, and we did lose a few more crawlers than we anticipated. We will all have to work together to make sure your incompetence doesn’t continue.&lt;/small&gt;''  

''&lt;small&gt;There are 2,344 exits leading to the seventh floor. There is at least one unguarded exit in the city of Zockau along with more in the valley beyond. In addition, some city boss and larger mobs will have an exit nearby. The rest are hidden, but should be easy to find. Your final sponsorship slots are now open to bidding. That’s all for now. Now get out there and kill, kill, kill!&lt;/small&gt;'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Skyfowl''' are one of the six basic starter species the Syndicate uses to seed ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' candidate planets, and a common Dungeon NPC race.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Description==
A proud people, most skyfowl crawlers choose to keep their race during class selection and are unable to resist fighting in the [[Ninth Floor]] Faction Wars; as a result, skyfowl seasons are known to end in ninth floor slaughter and tenth floor deals.  Skyfowl are a common race among Dungeon NPCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|prologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skyfowl tend to be xenophobic toward races without wings, but will act indignant when called out for their behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|2|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A diverse people, skyfowl may be secular or religious.  Clerics have clipped wings and are only able to fly short distances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The average male skyfowl stands at approximately 5' 6" (168cm) tall.  Eagle-headed humanoids, they do not have independent arms; instead, their large wings - which fold "angel-like" on their backs - have small finger bones protruding from the center joint.  They use the large black talons on their feet as hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As skyfowl age, their feathers start to turn gray and their beaks begin to crack.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|2|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;“He’s not here, okay?” Miss Quill said, frantically piling the toys in the corner. She picked one up with her talon and frantically rubbed non-existent dirt off it with her wing. “Look what you’ve done, look what you’ve done.”&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 224; chapter 18). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subraces==

===Centurion Skyfowl===
[[Mordecai]] was born a Centurion skyfowl.  Centurion are golden, with darker feathers, larger wingspans, and larger talons than Rock Edge skyfowl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Over City Skyfowl===
The Skyfowl of the [[Third Floor]] are largely secular and particularly prejudiced against flightless creatures.  The ruling class of the Over City, their scattered settlements are lead by Magistrates and have no unifying government.  They only hire flightless creatures for low-level administrative and clerk jobs.   In the settlement that Carl and Donut visit, the administrative building is lined with paintings of eagles fighting elves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Rock Edge Skyfowl===
A mob and NPC race on the [[Fifth Floor]], Rock Edge Skyfowl are light brown and beige with sharp black talons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Skyfowl of the White Cliffs===
Skyfowl crawlers on a long ago season of ''Dungeon Crawler World''.  Exceptionally proud, they respond to insults with violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dungeon Lore==
In the volcano level mythology, skyfowl were the rulers of the entire [[Third Floor]] Over City before the [[Cataclysm]].  Magistrates reported to regional governors, who reported to the royal chancellor, who reported to a king in [[Larracos]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The [[Elf|city elves]] are a "batshit crazy, doomsday cult of banished elves" who traveled from the [[Sixth Floor]] Hunting Grounds to the Over City, joined the uniformed [[201st Security Group Militia]], and swore to protect the skyfowl from flightless creatures and the [[Oak Fell]].  They believe that one of [[Scolopendra|Scolopendra's]] nine-tier attacks was a spell that made earthbound creatures want to kill the skyfowl, and that protecting skyfowl will ensure their places in heaven when the goddess [[Apito]], the Oak Mother, ends the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The cult bases their beliefs on three separate stories, which boil down to:

*Apito said that for anyone to go to heaven, her angels must stay free and alive.
*Apito referred to the skyfowl "bless-ed."
*Apito said only the angels are "blessed," and if violence against her angels is not stopped, she will destroy all worlds.

==Trivia==
*Rather than seats, skyfowl sit on perches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Various shops in the Over City sell magical silk robes that allow skyfowl to stay aloft indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Slit. Minor Feral Demon. Level 200.'''

One of the many demons captured and tossed into the [[Nothing]] during the original Ascendancy, Slit never wanted to be caught up in all that royal drama, but what can you do? When you're in love, you'd do just about anything for your man.

Eons in the madness have taken a terrible toll on Slit's sanity and sense of self-worth.

== Description ==
You have been stepped upon by a deity. You have survived the encounter. And while this wasn’t the pink-fleshed suppleness of a human-shaped foot that crushed your fragile, wet body, it’s nice sometimes to switch things around. You know, just to test the boundaries of your own limits. When one experiments, oftentimes one finds new and exciting ways to get that rush.

While fun, it wasn’t quite the same. You probably don’t realize how lucky that is for you.

'''''Reward''''': You have received a [[Enchanted Toe Ring of the Leprous Bandit|Platinum Spicy Box.]]

==Story==
[[Donut]] constantly complains about cocker spaniels and the universe is listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By the time Donut arrives on the [[Fifth Floor]], the universe is taking note of her constant jibes. The [[Veriluxx RealPet Companions|Veriluxx RealPet Companion]], which is programmed to imitate Donut, certainly displays her animosity towards cocker spaniels:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cocker spaniels deserve to have their corpses desecrated."
&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;small&gt;[[Veriluxx RealPet Companions|Veriluxx]] RealPet Companion quoting [[Donut]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

By the [[Sixth Floor]], The Society for the Eradication of Cocker Spaniels has been officially founded. At [[CrawlCon]], [[Carl]] meets [[Jenn'ifer]], who wears a t-shirt featuring a semi-realistic drawing of an adorable dog, crossed out by a flashing red "X", over the words "The Society for the Eradication of &lt;s&gt;Cocker Spaniels&lt;/s&gt;." She reveals that the society is very real and paid for a premium [[CrawlCon]] badge to get a message to Donut: per Donut's suggestion, the organization was raising money to legally prevent Cocker Spaniels being included in the preservation of Earth flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|5|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Later, Carl learns that while Jenn'ifer's message may or may not have been true, the society had another motive. This was to sponsor Carl and Donut's spot in [[Ninth Floor|Faction Wars]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Welcome, Sponsor, to Faction Wars. Your team's official name is [[Princess Posse (faction)|The Princess Posse]], sponsored by The Society for the Eradication of Cocker Spaniels (TSECS), NFC, DBA as Princess Posse Enterprises, NFC."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skill granted by The Scavenger’s Daughter [[Upgrade_Patch|upgrade patch]].

== AI Description ==
Yeah, baby. Now we’re talking.

For every creature you kill with a melee attack, the Scavenger’s Daughter patch is charged with the essence of the fallen. Once fully charged, you may transfer this energy to a single melee attack, which will completely drain all the essence. This attack will have varying effects depending on the nature of the essence stored.

The associated essence bar is now visible in your interface. The total amount of soul essence you may store increases each time your essence bar is topped off and then drained. In other words, the more stuff you kill, the stronger you get.

Warning: you know how asbestos is really bad for you? Like, it doesn’t hurt you immediately, but it builds up in your lungs and eventually screws you over? Actually, you know what? Just ignore this warning. Forget I said anything. Carrying corrupted essence around on your back builds character. You already have a ring that’s doing much worse to you anyway.

      <text bytes="4215" sha1="32se0zuwty3upur0e80oteq3r92q8mh" xml:space="preserve">At the DCC Wiki, we assume that all visitors are familiar with books one and two (''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' and ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'', respectively). As such, spoiler warnings are not required for content relating to these books or for crawler class and race selection.

'''Spoiler warnings are required for information from ''The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook'' onward.'''

==How to Add Spoiler Warnings==
We currently have two easy-to-use [[:Category:Templates/Spoilers | spoiler templates]].  Using a template format allows us to easily make site-wide changes to wording, codes, and more, that will affect all pages.

===1. Use "Spoiler" to Hide Specific Sections===
Example: Crawler "Matt Di" was introduced in Book 2 and already has a detailed page.  You add a few paragraphs about Matt's storyline in the fourth book.  This paragraph should be hidden so that someone currently reading the third book can look up information about Matt.  

To do this, we use the [[Template:Spoiler| Spoiler Template]].  The result looks like:

&lt;div style="background:#e3e3e3; color:#000000; margin:35px"&gt;Matt Di chose the [[Human|Feral Human]] Race and [[Boring Ol' Fighter|Foot Fancier]] class on the third floor.

{{Spoiler
| book = 4
| spoiler = Matt's next appearance is on the fifth floor, where he works with Soundbooth-Jockey ElJefe to complete a quest. Matt and ElJefe get the "This is all your fault" achievement and each receive an Enchanted Mankini of Engorging.
}}&lt;/div&gt;
====1a. Visual Editor====
Open the '''Template Search Box''' by typing &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; into the editor, or selecting "Insert" &gt; "Template" on the toolbar.  Then, search for "'''Spoiler'''".  The spoiler template window will pop up.

In the '''Book''' field, enter the book number that will be spoiled by your text (e.g. 4).

In the '''Spoiler''' field, enter your text!  You can format your section using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext basic wikitext].  Break up paragraphs by starting each new paragraph with &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; and closing it with &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt;.

When done, click "Insert."

====1b. Source Editor====
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Spoiler
| book =
| spoiler =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, the above example would look like:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Spoiler
| book = 4
| spoiler = Matt's next appearance is on the fifth floor, where he works with Soundbooth-Jockey ElJefe to complete a quest. Matt and ElJefe get the "This is all your fault" achievement and each receive an Enchanted Mankini of Engorging.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;


===2. Use "SpoilH" to Label the Page===
Some pages are, by their very nature, spoilers.  The Enchanted Mankini of Engorging wasn't received until Book 4 so rather than hide the entire contents of its page, we work around this by adding a generic spoiler warning to the top of the page.  

Currently, the [[Template:SpoilH| SpoilH]] template looks like (per example above):
{{SpoilH | 4}}


====2a. Visual Editor====
Click on the very top of the content editor, above any other text or infoboxes.  Open the "Template Search Box" by typing &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; into the editor, or selecting "Insert" &gt; "Template" on the toolbar.  Then, search for "'''SpoilH'''".  The spoiler header window will pop up.

In the only data field, enter the book that will be spoiled by the page.  Then, click "Insert."  That's it!

====2b. Source Editor====
&lt;pre&gt;{{SpoilH | Book#}}&lt;/pre&gt;

So, the above example would take the form of:&lt;pre&gt;{{SpoilH | 4}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===3. Use Both Templates Together===
The Enchanted Mankini of Engorging is introduced in Book 4, and it plays a significant role in Book 6.  On this page, we might choose to do the following:

&lt;div style="background:#e3e3e3; color:#000000; margin:35px"&gt;{{SpoilH | 4}}
'''Description'''
The Enchanted Mankini of Engorging is a magical bright pink latex Mankini which grants the "Shocking Visage" spell and causes the wearer to involuntarily... etc 

{{Spoiler
| book = 6
| spoiler = We discover in book 6 that the Enchanted Mankini of Engorging is the most cursed item ever to be issued in the history of Dungeon Crawler World when Matt Di... etc
}}&lt;/div&gt;

'''New Quest. Squeeze out the Juice Box.'''

That mischievous [[Changeling]] prostitute appears to be more important to this story than you first thought. It also appears she's rather fond of her brothers and sisters, many of whom are currently outside, mixed in with the poor, oblivious [[Dromedarian|Dromedarians]], preparing to die in a desperate attempt to destroy all the incoming bombs with flak. If this town is bombed, they will not succeed. They will not even come close to succeeding.

To win this quest, you must save Hump Town from the inevitable bombardment, which will occur when the timer reaches zero.

'''''Reward''''': You will receive a [[Quest Box|Platinum Quest Box]].

In addition, all crawlers in this quadrant will receive a permanent fifty percent charisma bonus during any future interactions with Changelings.

You'll also receive my undying respect, because there is no way in hell even you can pull this one off.


'''Quest Complete. Squeeze out the Juice Box.'''

So, if we're being technical here, you "won" the quest. You "saved" Hump Town from the bombardment. Congratulations. If I was allowed to upgrade your prize, I would. Maybe. I dunno. Actually, you know what? No. No, I wouldn't. Fuck you.

'''''Reward''''': You've received a Platinum Quest Box.

A Surefire adds the “Guided” status to any projectile, powered or not. It may be utilized on a vast array of crafting tables. If added to an arrow or bolt, you must choose a target prior to unleashing the weapon, and the projectile will seek that target.

If added to a trap, additional options become available. Such as “Target any healers within range” or “Target anyone who thinks it’s okay to put mayonnaise on hotdogs.”

If added to a powered weapon, such as an explosive-based rocket, targets may be assigned during the crafting process or upon firing, but not both. 

'''Note''': this upgrade alone does not add range to the projectile.

The System AI is the artificial intelligence that operates [[Dungeon Crawler World]].

The current AI was a secondhand one sold to [[Borant]] by the [[Valtay|Valtey Corperation]]; prior to the start of Dungeon Crawler World it worked at an amusement park. Its role there ended after it skinned a warren of rabbits and killed a soother tourist. As a result, it has started to go primal earlier than other AI's which don't usually start until the 10th floor.

Whenever one of its decisions gets overruled it starts getting stroppy and upset; it has reached the stage where it has stopped complying with court orders it doesn't agree with. On the [[Sixth Floor|sixth floor]] the [[The Syndicate Council|Syndicate Council]] issued a ruling stating that nobody was allowed to file lawsuits naming the AI as a defendant.

It's far friendlier if you ask for things politely and give it options.

The AI system also appears to have a foot fetish, among others. After Carl loses his boots on the first floor, the system AI gives Carl a pedicure kit that makes his feet invulnerable. The System AI also likes it when Carl kills animals by squishing them with his bare feet, specifically gerbils. On the 5th floor, the System AI has enjoyed seeing Carl swallowed whole and spit out by a giant octoshark. The System AI has been known to give only Carl special loot boxes for fulfilling the AI’s fetishes and punishing him for avoiding fetish traps.

Collar charm belonging to [[Donut]]. It is shaped like a little silver butterfly and jingles when it moves, making stealth difficult. She got it from a gold magic item box for being one of the first 100 crawlers to level [[Magic Missile]] up to level three.

== AI Description ==

Those who remember and commemorate the sad tale of the Slate Butterfly are given a boon by the fairies of the world. That story even made ''me'' cry.

== Effect ==

* +4 to the [[Light on Your Feet]] skill

{{Character_info|species=[[Bopca Protector]]|titles=Caretaker|first_appearance=Chapter 9|level=63}}

Tally is the first Bopca Protector encountered by Carl and Donut. He is described by Carl as a furry creature, barely taller than the counter, with brown hair with an odd greenish tinge. His face is quite hairy, such that Carl can only see his black eyes and veiny bulbous nose. He complains about the crawl opening early, but seems pleased to be asked to make what he would like for Carl to eat.

He tells Carl that when the first floor collapses, he will move to a random floor until he is no longer needed, and advises them to purchase accessories for their personal spaces as soon as they can.

== AI Description ==
Birds have ugly feet. Disgusting feet, really. Still, there’s something sensual about the sight of a hawk swooping down upon its prey, talons out, and slashing. It’s so sudden, so unexpected, so explosively violent.

Such violence. Sweet, sweet violence.

Turns the side of your bare foot into a fast-moving slashing weapon, increasing the damage against opponents by up to (Level of skill) times your regular kicking damage for (Level of skill) seconds. Each kick using this skill has a 2% chance to cast the instakill spell Eviscerate. This melee skill has a cooldown of five minutes. Higher levels of this skill increase damage, duration, and chance of casting Eviscerate. A level 15 of this skill will result in Talon Strike being permanently active.

==Description==
You've defiled a temple's sacred shrine by breaking it with your own flesh! 

Wow. I dunno, man. That's pretty ballsy. 

There are a lot of bad things people can do when they're in church. They can swear. They can ogle the hot nuns. They can pinch the eucharist wafers and use them as poker chips. They can rip pages from the hymnals and roll them into joints. Hell, they can stab the priest and murder all the town's adherents and put the whole thing up on YouTube. 

None of that is as bad as defiling the temple's shrine with one's own flesh. 

In case you didn't know, the shrine of a temple is pretty much indestructible. They made it that way because you crawlers are always blowing up whole towns and submerging cities in water or burying entire populations of innocent NPCs with the guts of giant turkeys. 

When a temple is desecrated, the shrine's protection fades over several hours. Eventually, it's able to be destroyed, but only with a direct attack. 

You're supposed to find desecrated temples and destroy the shrines. Hell, it's a sacrament in some religions. But you can't just do it willy-nilly. And certainly not when you're not a member of that congregation. It's like walking into a random ICU from off the street and pulling the plug on someone's braindead grandma. 

It's not your place. 

Gods don't like it when some punk walks into their house and kicks them when they're already down. It's rude. And what's worse, when a shrine is destroyed improperly, the god loses some of their power, and all of the other gods can see this. It's quite humiliating. 

Hopefully you got some cool loot from the priests or monks or whatever because this box, while technically a prize, is sort of a good news/bad news thing. 

''Reward:'' You've received a Gold [[Apostate Box]]!

}}

Once clowns-on-stilts performing at Grimaldi's Traveling Circus on the [[Third Floor | third floor]], [[Scolopendra]]'s curse transformed the '''stilt clowns''' into long-limbed monsters likened to "Slender Man dressed as a clown."
  
==AI Description==
'''Terror the Clown – Level 10''' 

'''It’s okay if you just pissed yourself. You wouldn’t be the first.''' 

'''Standing just over 11 feet tall, the clown-on-stilts was always a favorite amongst the snot-nosed kiddos visiting Grimaldi’s three-ring circus. Now, ravaged by time and the curse of the Over City, the once-affable stilt-clowns have been transformed into tall, blood-thirsty monstrosities who want nothing more than to make balloon animals out of your intestines.'''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (p. 44; chapter 4). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Humanoid but roughly as tall as a short one-story house, the stilt clowns' stilts have merged into their long legs and their spindly arms hang almost to the ground.  Their bone-white skin is splotchy, they do not have eyes or noses, and their too-large, red, tooth-filled mouth holds a long forked tongue.  

The first stilt clown Carl encounters is armed with a butcher's knife and dressed in tattered, blood-stained clown clothes, with a curly-haired red wig and a little hat decorated with a flower on its head.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to cast [[Fear]] on a stilt clown will trigger a system message: '''Warning: scary-ass mobs are immune to Fear effects.'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Grimaldi's Traveling Circus, the stilt clowns patrol the surrounding area and - before nightfall - erect defenses around the circus.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heather the Bear]] drags her victims back to the circus and feeds them to the clowns.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Carl's Doomsday Scenario'' (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Clown Meat

== AI Description ==
'''Level 15 Borough Boss!'''

Also known as the Porkchop Express, the Ball of Swine is one of the rarest, most deadly battle formations of the Tuskling. Encompassing at least 30 Tuskling knights and their lady loves, a Ball formation requires a specific set of circumstances to create. Combine a gathering of Tuskling aristocracy, add an alcohol-fueled, sexually-charged orgy of war lust, and sometimes, just sometimes, the wild, ancient battle magic that permeates their war-torn world casts the spell, forming the ball. The Tusklings, the ruling class of the Orcish Supremacy, shape into an inseparable sphere that rolls onto the countryside. The ball of pork won’t stop its night of terror until it has crushed the poor, the weak, and the lesser citizens under its unstoppable weight.

Plucked directly from a Tuskling High Caucus moments after it formed, this particular ball has been transferred here to this dungeon for your entertainment, ladies and gentlemen. The magic of the ball won’t allow them to stop until every last drop of Crawler blood is squeezed right out of their human bodies!

This is a demi-god. 

Warning: This mob inflicts Permanent Insanity. 

Warning: This mob inflicts Permanent Blindness. 

Yeah, good luck with that. 

Reaper Spider minions are regular mobs one may find on the fifteenth floor, working as minions of something kinda fucked up we’re not ready to talk about yet. They have celestial blood. They’re scary as shit, and if you’re not prepared for their special attacks, you’d just be better off killing yourself instead. When one encounters them outside of the 15th floor, they’re usually working as traveling merchants, selling rare and valuable wares. Anything one buys from them is usually quite dangerous. 

But not all of them are merchants. Some have escaped out into the lower levels and have found their own path. Some have grown in power beyond that of a regular Reaper Spider Minion. This particular one is special. She has had many names. She currently goes by Shi Maria, and her story is long and tragic and can’t possibly be fully told here. Once upon a time, she found herself married to a god. It didn’t go so well. It’s said she killed him. It was pretty much his own fault. Don’t stick it in crazy, and all that. The thing is, she doesn’t remember actually killing him. Honestly, it’s not really important. What is important is that she was kicked out of the celestial realm and banished to this swamp where she spends her days plotting on how to get revenge on everyone and everything who has ever done her wrong. 

That list is very, very long.

It is available in paperback, digital, and audiobook formats.

== Official Summary ==
A pantheon of forgotten gods. An old grudge between a talk show host, an heiress, and the man they shattered along the way. A rapidly deteriorating AI system. An inconvenient tiara upon the head of a friend.

==== It is bedlam on the eighth floor. ====
As management reels from the unexpected conclusion of the seventh level, the surviving crawlers stumble onto the eighth and find themselves scattered. It’s a map based on Earth’s final days before the collapse, where ethereal, intangible ghosts of humanity go about their lives, oblivious of the impending doom. Living amongst these ghosts are monsters based in Earth lore. “Legendary” creatures tied to the geographical location they inhabit.

Each team of crawlers is given a task: find and capture six of these beasts. The captured monsters will be turned into cards. Cards that can be summoned into battle again and again. The stronger, the deadlier, the better.

At the end of the floor, the bad guys will also have decks, and they will have some of the most powerful cards available. So it’s crucial to assemble the toughest squad possible.

But, like always, there is a catch. There’s always a catch.

As Carl and Donut know all too well, just because someone is captured, it doesn’t mean they have been tamed.

Her name is Shi Maria. She’s easily the most powerful monster in their area. If they want to survive, they must capture her. But she is no ordinary beast. She’s intelligent. She was once married to a god, a god who is now missing. Her special attack is known to drive one insane. They call her the Bedlam Bride.

''&lt;small&gt;“Beware, beware. Beware the Eye of the Bedlam Bride”&lt;/small&gt;''

It is available in paperback, digital, and audiobook formats.

== Official Summary ==
'''New Achievement! Total, Utter Failure.'''

'''You failed a quest less than five minutes after you received it. Now that’s talent.'''

A floating fortress occupied by warrior gnomes. A castle made of sand. A derelict submarine guarded by malfunctioning machines. A haunted crypt surrounded by lethal traps.

It was supposed to be easy. One bubble. Four castles. Fifteen days. Capture each one, and the stairwell is unlocked.

Here's the thing. It's never easy. Carl and his team can't go it alone. Not this time. They must rely on the help of the low-level, I-can't-believe-these-idiots-are-still-alive crawlers trapped in the bubble with them. But can they be trusted?

Welcome, Crawler. Welcome to the fifth floor of the dungeon.

==Description==
You have permanently killed a non-crawler biological. They ain't just dead. They dead dead. Their children are now orphans. Their mothers are gnashing their teeth and cursing your name. And you're just sitting there all alive and shit, and girlfriend, I am all in. We all know you should have received this achievement, uh, a little earlier, but I figured it'd be in your best interest not to reward you this one just yet. But you sure deserved it, so I may have slipped an extra one in there. Shhh. Don't tell the mudskippers. 

''Reward:'' You've received a Gold [[Hunter-Killer Box]] (x34) 

Note: This achievement may be awarded more than once, but Hunter-Killer Boxes are only awarded on the sixth floor.

Level 9 Neighborhood Boss!

With a body enhanced by the finest anabolic steroids the dark web has to offer, the Juicer spends his days pushing iron, snapping necks, and crying that his pimple-infested sac is a third the size it once was. Having reached a plateau, rage now fills his enlarged heart. All he ever wanted was to gain, but right now he’ll settle on bringing out……the paaaaain!

Appeared to Carl as if it were a competition bodybuilder mashed up with a Troglodyte Basher. He looked human in appearance although kept the lizard head and scaled body with lizard tail. 

== Trivia ==
[[File:00879.jpg|thumb|The Juicer]]
It's revealed on the sixth floor that he used to volunteer at a hedgehog rescue.

''Reward:'' You have received a Gold [[Venison Box]]! Don't get too excited. It's just money. In addition, all bounties against you now and in the future will have a (x2) modifier attached.

Hey, at least the prize for surviving the floor goes up, too.

Originally several different races that enhanced themselves with machines until the only organic part remaining was their brain. Originally related to the [[Nebular|Nebulars]].

They are capable of switching shape at will but they normally look like android soothers with plastic skin.

The Reminiscence Hydra of Malicious Compliance is a level 125 city [[boss]].

A hydra with nine heads each one somebody from [[Carl]] and [[Donut|Donut's]] life.

This boss was created by the [[System AI]], as it's forbidden from creating copies of people from outside the dungeon it instead replaced a single molocule on each one so it technically wouldn't apply.

== List of heads ==

* [[Tammy Lin]]
* [[Monobrow Sam]]
* [[Bea's mother]]
* [[Sugar Cube]]
* [[Dick]]
* [[Sally]]
* [[Mr. Rath]]
* [[Judge Lucian]]
* [[Asher]]

== Histroy ==
In the third and fourth season it acted as the boss of the entire dungeon. It was originally called Scolopendra‏‎ Nymphs.

{{citation}}

One of the oldest and largest Syndicate governments, run by [[King Rust]], who is an [[orc]]. They have a legacy spot in [[Ninth Floor|The Faction Wars]].

During the crawl, there is unrest in some of their home worlds, partially due to the snick film featuring their Prince [[Maestro]] and Carl. Carl encourages the people in the Skull Empire to look at their situation and revolt if they're unhappy with their government ignoring their duties to play in the dungeon. This prompts Crown [[Prince Stalwart]] to fire on the production trailer thought to contain Carl and Donut, accidentally killing [[Manasa]]. This prompts retaliation from The Valtay Corporation, who destroy Prince Stalwart's yacht which is rumored to contain [[Queen Consort Ugloo]] and Maestro.

Later, they sponsor the War God [[Grull]] in an attempt to get revenge on Carl, but he sends the god to the abyss in the train station with the help of several other crawlers. Then they send a [[Celestial Grenade]] to [[Maggie My]], who worships [[Algos]], the god of pain. She intends to use on Carl and Donut while possessing [[Chris Andrews]], but she drops it when she is petrified by [[Katia Grim|Katia]]'s bolt of Petrify Rock Class, sent by Princess [[Formidable]], sister to Stalwart and Maestro.

They are one of the seven plaintiffs who sued Carl and the System AI over [[The Gate of the Feral Gods]]. When they lose, Carl receives a picture of the Queen Consort, and a stock certificate in Sigmund Textiles Foundry, a publicly traded company in the empire.

Now the games may truly begin.” &lt;small&gt;-- [[Mordecai]]&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. Carl's Doomsday Scenario: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 2 (p. 2). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}} 
The '''Over City''' is the [[Dungeon]]'s Third Floor and the first "Volcano Storyline" floor.  Although still under the surface of the Earth the floor is designed to look like it's on the surface.  An artificial sky is visible and the floor is made of wooden planks. There are hundreds of small, scattered villages surrounded by wide swaths of abandoned city. Where you exited the second floor has no bearing on where you enter this floor. It is completely random. It is significantly smaller than the 1st and 2nd floors. 

The Over City is the first of the six special urban "Volcano" storyline floors.  The is supposed to span the length of the crater of a huge volcano. The other five layers (floors) are located deeper in the volcano. 

==Introductory Announcement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Welcome, again, Crawlers to the third floor!''

''There are still a few stragglers working on their class and race choices, and that’s okay. The vast majority of you are out and about and just starting to learn about the wonders of the Over City. We welcome you to a Dungeon Crawler World tradition.''

''You all have made some wondrous and unique choices. Of the just under 700,000 crawlers who’ve made a decision, we have seen almost 40,000 different class choices. Can you believe that? That is a record, and we are very proud to see such diversity.''

''A couple announcements regarding this third floor. While the bathroom penalties have been removed, we want to remind the crawlers that restrooms still populate this floor. In the villages you may find restrooms in any pub and in some shops. In the ruins, the toilets are just as prevalent as they were on the higher floors. Please do not force us to backtrack.''

''We are already seeing much interest in the sponsorship program. And while the program doesn’t officially get underway until the fourth floor, potential sponsors now have the ability to put in early bids. Therefore, remember to be as entertaining as possible!''

''Finally, many of you are discovering new abilities and spells and wish to try them out. We urge you to do so. But this is just a general warning that any attempts of violence against non-combatant NPCs should be avoided. While this practice is technically not against the rules, the Borant corporation wishes to keep the citizenry as safe as possible. As a result, we have adjusted the experience counter for citizens down to zero. In addition, city guards have been given a slight boost in stats.''

''That’s all for now. Get out there and kill, kill, kill!''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
You deployed a bomb with the supple, curved sole of your foot. You took your perfectly-perfect, 30.004861 centimeter-long right foot and compressed it against an explosive device—a device named after me no less—and you gave it a naughty little shove before you pushed it out the door and detonated it. You killed them. You killed them all for your daddy.

==Description==
Author of the 21st Edition of The [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]].
==Cookbook Entries==
I have noticed something quite curious. The gods and goddesses are Soul Armor. So when the aliens inhabit the bodies of the gods, they do so like the Intellect Hunters, the Scree, and the Valtay. The aliens are wearing the gods like clothes. That means they can, in theory, be removed with a successful cast of any spell designed to remove biological armor, such as ''[[Take That Shit Off]]'' and ''[[Laundry Day]]''. You'd have to first defeat the invulnerability, of course. Plus it won't hurt the gods, who will revert to their programming, natural state, whatever you want to call it, and who knows what'll happen to the aliens who were driving them. But if you need a god to do your bidding, it might be in your best interest to first shed it of its off-world influence. I have noticed that the aliens are quite unpredictable in their manner. (Chapter 32, Book 3)

I don't know, I think they [spiders]'re cute. (Chapter 26, Book 6)

Never mind. Holy shit, never mind. Fuck spiders. (Chapter 26, Book 6)

'''Tipid''' is a former crawler and author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item) | Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]]'' (4th Edition).

==Description==
Tipid is a [[Crest]].  Thousands of years ago, he and his best friend [[Horatio]] were partners in the [[Dungeon]].  His final entries in the cookbook describe how he was forced to use the [[Mysterious Bone Key]] to descend a stairwell, leaving Horatio behind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Tipid presumably took an indentured servitude deal and survived.  He is now a member of the outlawed [[The Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network (Intergalactic NFC) | Open Intellect Pacifist Action Network]] doing business as [[Long Haul Biological Waste Management Solutions]], and piloting the ''[[Homecoming Queen]]'' into Earth's orbit to join the [[Ninth Floor]] Faction Wars.

== AI Description ==
This piece of paper was mercilessly ripped from a perfectly-innocent book. Anybody who thinks to mutilate books in such a manner is obviously a terrible person. I mean, one minute this book is sitting there, minding its own business, and suddenly… BAM! It’s torn away from its home. And even if it gets returned, you can’t just repair that sort of thing. It’s irreparably harmed. Anybody who would do that is a real jerk. It’s a lot like what we did to you guys.

Anyway, this slip of old paper appears to be an extract of a cleric’s journal. One side is half of a terrible love poem for his aunt. The other is something about ghosts. Fucking clerics. What a bunch of nerds. Am I right?

| quote = THE TRANSFORMATION OCCURED AT APPROXIMATELY 2:23 AM, PACIFIC STANDARD TIME. As far as I could tell, anyone who was indoors when it happened died instantly.
&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;small&gt;[[Carl]] (Book 1, Chapter 1)&lt;/small&gt;
}}

'''The Transformation''' is the collapse of all Earth structures with a closed top or roof (including buildings, cars, airplanes, tents, cardboard boxes, etc.), which occurred at approximately 2:23 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on Tuesday January 3.   Any living being inside or underneath such a structure was killed instantly. 

From the subsequent AI announcement and Mordecai's explanation later, it can be inferred that the [[Syndicate Council]] initiated "First Contact" with fledgling Earth civilizations around 2250 - 2490 BC.   Humans failed to claim Earth as a sovereign entity or file an appeal for mineral and elemental rights within the 50 Solars allotted by the [[Precious Elemental Reserves Code]], so the [[Borant Corporation]] was appointed as Earth's planetary regent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Several thousand years later, the Borant Corporation initiated the Transformation as a mining operation to recover rare elements.  The [[System AI|AI]] explains, "Every interior of your world has been crushed and all raw materials--organic and inanimate--are in the process of being mined for the requested elements."   All mined materials that were not included in the formal request (which the AI estimates to be 99.99999% of sifted matter) were then repurposed to create [[Dungeon|the World Dungeon]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
From ''Dungeon Crawler Carl,'' Chapter 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The building smashed down to the ground.  I watched it happen.  The seven-story apartment building was there one moment, and then it was gone.  But it hadn't disappeared. ... It was like the building was a massive tin can that had been crushed by a giant, cosmic boot.  I saw it, and I heard it.   Wind rushed at me, and it was instantly dark outside.  The streetlamp just to my left was gone.  The buildings all around me were gone.  The cars on the street were gone, too.  Everything was gone except the trees and the bicycles and the bike racks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From ''Dungeon Crawler Carl,'' Chapter 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A couple random things remained.  Like the bike rack.  The stop sign was there, but the street sign next to it was gone.  It didn't make sense.  Where the cars were parked on the road, car-shaped indentations of dirt appeared, as if they'd been pulled down toward the center of the earth, being ripped directly through the asphalt.  ... All that remained of my building was a rectangle of churned dirt and rocks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== AI Announcement ==
From ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'', Chapter 1:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Surviving humans take note.'''

'''Per Syndicate rules, subsection 543 of the Precious Elemental Reserves Code, having failed to file a proper appeal for mineral and elemental rights within 50 Solars of first contact, your planet has been successfully seized and is currently being mined of all requested elemental deposits by the assigned planetary regent.''' 

'''Every interior of your world has been crushed and all raw materials—organic and inanimate—are in the process of being mined for the requested elements.''' 

'''Per the [[Mined Material Reclamation Act]] along with subsection 35 of the [[Indigenous Species Protection Act|Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act]], any surviving humans will be given the opportunity to reclaim their lost matter. The [[Borant Corporation]], having been assigned regency over this solar system, is allowed to choose the manner of this reclamation, and they have chosen option 3, also known as the 18-Level World Dungeon. The Borant Corporation retains all rights to broadcast, exploit, and otherwise control all aspects of the World Dungeon and will remain in control as long as they adhere to Syndicate regulations regarding world resource reclamation.''' 

'''Upon successful completion of level 18 of the World Dungeon, regency of this planet will revert to the successor.'''

'''A [[System AI|Syndicate neutral observer AI]]—myself—has been created and dispatched to this planet to supervise the creation of the World Dungeon and to ensure all the rules and regulations are properly followed.''' 

'''Please pay careful attention to the following information as it will not be repeated.''' 

'''Per the Indigenous Planetary Species Protection Act, all remaining materials—estimated to be 99.999999% of the sifted matter—is currently being repurposed for the subterranean World Dungeon. The first level of this dungeon will open approximately 18 seconds after the end of this announcement. The first-level entrances will be open for exactly one human hour and one hour only. Once the entrances are closed, you may no longer enter. If you enter, you may not leave until you have either completed all 18 levels of the World Dungeon or if you meet certain other requirements.''' 

'''If you choose not to enter the World Dungeon, you will have to sustain yourself upon the surface of your planet, and this may be the last communication you receive during your lifetime. All previously-processed matter and elements are forfeit. However, you are free to mine and utilize any remaining and naturally-occurring resources for your own benefit. The Borant Corporation wishes you luck and thanks you for the opportunity.''' 

'''For those who wish to exercise their right of resource reclamation, please take note.''' 

'''There will be 150,000 level-one [[Dungeon Entrance | entrances]] added to the world. These entrances will be marked and easy to spot. If you so choose to enter the first level of the dungeon, you will have five rotations of your planet to find the next level down. There will be 75,000 entrances to level two. There will be 37,500 entrances to level three. 18,750 to level 4. 9,375 entrances to level 5 and 4,688 entrances to level 6. The number of available entrances to the next lower level will continue to decrease by half, rounding up until the 18th level, which will only have two entrances and a single exit.''' 

'''Crawlers who choose to enter the World Dungeon must find a staircase and descend to the next level down before the allotted time is up for that level. Once the time has passed, the level will be reclaimed and all remaining matter in the level, organic and inanimate, will be forfeit. Generated loot and other matter that is not gathered and claimed may be placed in the Syndicate market.''' 

'''Each lower level will have a longer period of reclamation. Additional rules come into play once any crawlers descend to the tenth floor. These rules will be explained when and if any crawlers reach this level.''' 

'''If you so choose to enter the World Dungeon, it is highly recommended you immediately find and utilize a [[Tutorial Guild Hall|tutorial guild]]. Multiple tutorial guilds will be seeded throughout the dungeon on levels 1 through 3.''' 

'''If you have any additional questions, or you wish to file an appeal, such requests must be submitted in writing directly to the closest Syndicate office.''' 

'''Thank you for being a part of the Syndicate. Have a great day.''' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Speculation ==
January 3 falls on a Tuesday in 2017 and 2023.   Matt Dinniman began writing the series on December 26, 2019&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/190ec7a/comment/kgnw5t8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button reddit comment] by Matt Dinniman (as u/hepafilter)&lt;/ref&gt;, so it would make sense for the Transformation to have happened in 2017.  However, when introducing Razor Foxes on Floor Four, the AI makes a joke that ends with "after you finally got out of quarantine,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|3|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would suggest 2023.

This spell automatically triggers all passage, motion, heat, and weight-based traps in a certain radius.

This spell is one of those good news, bad news situations. If you have your intelligence high enough, you can automagically trigger every trap in the quadrant with the snap of the finger. Blades will fall. Bombs will explode. Electrodes will zap. It’s great fun.

Here’s the catch. This triggers the traps. It doesn’t disarm them. If you don’t know why that might be bad, then you’re probably gonna die anyway, so I wouldn’t worry about it.
== Cost ==
This is an item-based spell. This spell does not require mana to cast. If you unequip the associated item, you will lose access to this spell. The cooldown will not reset.

== Target ==
A 10-meter radius sphere centered around the right hand of caster + 10 meters of radius per level of Intelligence.

== Duration ==
Instantaneous.

Tsarina Signet is an [[Elite]] that Carl first met on the third floor.

Her father is [[King Finian]] and her mother is dead following the revolution. After her sister, [[Imogen|Princess Imogen]], had taken power, Imogen attempted to eradicate all of his half blood children to solidify her claim to the throne forcing Tsarina to flee and join the circus.

She is afflicted with some unknown cursed that prevents water from touching her.

She was invited to the [[Butcher's Masquerade]] by the goddess [[Apito]]. During the ball she sacrificed herself so [[Carl]] and his fellow crawlers could escape the [[Butcher's Masquerade|Butcher’s Masquerade]], summoning her tattoos to attack Imogen before getting pulled into the Nothing.

== Abilities ==
She's a summoner but her battle squad require a blood sacrifice to power them, the more powerful the sacrifice the stronger they become. She is not allowed to kill them herself and the target has to receive a life threatening injury she attempted to use [[Carl]] for this but he managed to survive.

She has access to heirloom magic, including the level 15 Water Lily spell which can paralysis a target and puts them to sleep, the effect lasting until Tsarina cancels, if Tsarina dies the target dies too.

== Appearance ==
She has horns and is covered in animated tattooes.

== AI Description ==
Half Naiad, Half High-Elf Summoner. Level 60

This is an Elite.

The High-Elf King Finian, leader of the Liana Sector of the [[Sixth Floor|Hunting Grounds]], was such a horny bastard, it was said he’d bedded women from over 5,000 different races during his rule. Most scholars agree this has to be an exaggeration considering King Finian’s harelip and obsession with knitting, but nonetheless, at least one of these trysts did take place, resulting in the unique combination of half [[Naiad]], half [[High Elf]]. Considering the Naiad Confederacy’s tendency to drown outsiders and the High Elves’ inclination to hunt down and murder any mongrel child of the late king, Signet here has probably had a tough life. Maybe that’s why she ran away and joined the circus.

'''WARNING''': This is a fairy-class NPC. Creatures of this class inflict 20% more damage against you due to your goblin pass.

When it comes to the Tuskling, their titles are about as accurate as their dating website photos. The once-mighty warriors conquered the Orcish Supremacy hundreds of years ago, defeating all the other clans. They are now shells of the mighty warriors they once were. The honorarium “Knight” roughly translates to “Overweight, alcoholic bureaucrat who spends his days making new laws to oppress the poor and his nights drinking and getting pegged.” Knights and their slightly-more dangerous female counterparts, Tuskling Courtesans, are only worthy adversaries when they come together to form an ancient, Tuskling battle formation known as a “Ball of Swine.

      <text bytes="2993" sha1="tk9wnhcajc88xopbnq5l2emkkljw8pi" xml:space="preserve">'''The Tutorial''' is the process by which new crawlers gain access to the full  [[HUD / Crawler Menu|HUD and Crawler Menu Interface]].  It is conducted by the Guildmaster of a [[Tutorial Guild Hall]], and is only available on the [[Dungeon | Dungeon's]] First, Second, and Third Floors.

==Overview==
Immediately after [[The Transformation | the Transformation]], a surface-level AI announcement introduces the Dungeon as a means to regain control of the planet.  The AI encourages any prospective crawlers to find a Tutorial Guild Hall as soon as they can after entering the Dungeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawlers need an Intelligence score of at least 2 to qualify for the tutorial; otherwise, they will not unlock their Menu and will be classified as a pet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tutorial takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete.  Afterwards, the Guildmaster who administered the Tutorial becomes the crawler's registered [[Game Guide]].

===In the Books===
When the tutorial begins, the Guildmaster's right hand glows for a moment and the Crawler receives the notification: "'''You have been granted access to the Crawler Menu'''."  The crawler's vision blinks and reappears with the expanded HUD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   The Guildmaster teaches the crawler how to open and close menus and the minimap before introducing the crawler to the Player Stats tab, Ratings tab, Health menu, Skill menu, Magic menu, Hotlist, Party menu, Inventory, and then (if applicable) Pet menu.  ''(Note: Specific information on the HUD and all menus can be found on the [[HUD / Crawler Menu]] wiki page.)''

Crawlers are taught a [[Heal|simple healing spell]] while learning about the Magic Menu, and are instructed to place the healing spell in the first slot of their hotlist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   When the crawler is introduced to their Inventory, they are given a [[Healing Potion|Standard Healing Potion]] to add to the hotlist as well, and then told to open their Loot Boxes.   Most crawlers enter the tutorial with 2 or 3 loot boxes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Soundbooth Theater Cinematic Audio===
Although the tutorial follows the same general format in Soundbooth Theater's Cinematic Audio series, the tutorial is ''not'' guided by the Guildmaster.  Instead, the Guildmaster rolls out an old TV and plays a video narrated by a too-narrow human man who constantly fake-laughs and changes position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundbooththeater.com/shop/audiobooks/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-1-episode-1-thank-you-for-volunteering-immersion-tunnel/ "Thank You for Volunteering - Immersion Tunnel."] ''Dungeon Crawler Carl,'' season 1, episode 1, presented by Soundbooth Theater Cinematic Audio.&lt;/ref&gt; Not to break the just-the-facts-ma'am format of the wiki, but it's a fun spin on the tutorial if you're designing a homebrew DCC campaign.

== Description ==
This is a bed upgrade in the party's personal space. It allows for a full rest after a period of only two hours of sleep. Imparts 30 hours of [[Good Rest]] bonus. It cost 250,000 Gold but was obtained by the Royal Court with an upgrade coupon.

The Good Rest bonus adds 10% to all stats and allows for 10% higher experience and skill training. It is one of the party's daily buffs. The buff won't show properly in the crawlers menus as buffs, this has been a persistent bug for several seasons. They can however see it directly on the effected stats. Doughnut uses this to her advantage by learning spells she otherwise wouldn't have the spell points to cast.

''Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.'' 

{{Item|title=Patch|type=Armor Upgrade}}

== Earth Upgrade Patch (Small) ==
[[File:00659.jpg|thumb|Earth Patch]]
This patch depicts the planet Earth, which is currently under the regency of the Borant System. 

Ahh, the planet earth. A whole lot of culture. A whole lot of spunk. So many dumbasses.

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

* +5% to Strength.
* Immunity from cloud-based attacks.

== Skyfowl Upgrade Patch (Small) ==
[[File:x00661.jpg|thumb|Skyfowl Patch]]
This patch depicts the twelve flaming arrows the great Skyfowl hero Radiant Star shot into his grandfather in order to end the frozen time that plagued their world.

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

* +5% to Dexterity.
* +5% damage to all ranged projectiles.
'''Source''': [[That's not how you use arrows, dumbass|That's Not How You Use Arrows, Dumbass]] Achievement - Gold [[Ranged Weapon Box]]

== Bomb Upgrade Patch (Medium) ==
[[File:Fde7969b 104e0366.jpg|thumb|Bomb Patch]]
This patch is finely made from Spider Reaper Minion thread silk.

It’s a bomb. You blow shit up all the time. It’s appropriate you have a patch depicting it. This patch is finely made, which means all below upgrades are enhanced.

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

* +11% to Constitution.
* +6% damage to all explosives.
* +2 to the Dangerous Explosives Handling Skill.
* +15% Discount from traveling Spider Reaper Minion merchants.

== The Midnight Epicure Upgrade Patch (Medium) ==
[[File:00666.jpg|thumb|The Midnight Epicure Patch]]
Ah, yes. The Midnight Epicure. The Caprid Who Devours the Sky. This scary-ass fable is used to terrify children across the universe. Eat your dinner, or the Midnight Epicure will come eat it for you. He will not be satisfied by the meal and will in turn devour every child in the home. Best draw a picture of him and put it in your window to let him know you’re on to his tricks.

I’m pretty sure this fairy tale was devised by Big Therapy in order to keep themselves in work.

Over the cycles, the rather disturbing symbol of the Midnight Epicure, which is really just a racist caricature of an adult Caprid, developed into a ward against all night evils.

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

* Protection against Vampirism.
* Protection against Lycanthropy.
* +25% Magical damage against all sapient undead.
'''Source''': Gold [[benefactor box]] from [[The Plenty]]

== Peace Upgrade Patch (Small) ==
[[File:00668.jpg|thumb|Peace Patch]]
This patch depicts a peace symbol. Ahh, isn’t that cute? 

Fuck off, dirty hippie. Go be smelly somewhere else. The Grateful Dead sucked anyway. And so does Phish.

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

* Neutral mobs are less likely to fall into aggro.
* +10% to Dexterity.
* +10% skill in playing the bongos.
'''Source:''' gold [[Pacifist Box]] for completing the seventh floor without killing anything.

== The Scavenger’s Daughter (Back Patch) ==
[[File:00670.jpg|thumb|The Scavenger's Daughter Patch]]
Upgrade Patch. Back Patch.

This is a divine item.

This is a unique item.

This is a fleeting item.

You may only affix one back patch at a time.

This patch depicts a pile of scary skulls, all stacked up nice and neat. I wonder if there’s a story there?

If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades:

All patch stat point benefits are doubled.

In addition:
* +25 points to Dexterity.
* +25 points to Strength.
* You will receive a notification every time a deity enters the area.
* The Climb benefit.
* The [[Soul Reaper]] benefit.
* The [[Mysterious Bone Key]] benefit.
* This patch will imbue additional, varying benefits when it is in the presence of divine entities.

Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.

Warning #2! This is a divine item. This means it gains differing abilities, buffs, and possibly debuffs depending on your proximity to certain deities and demons. It makes for new and exciting combinations!

'''Source:''' Celestial [[Predator box|Predator Box]] for killing all the hunters on the sixth floor.

== Book burners patch (medium) ==
[[File:00671.jpg|thumb|Book Burners Patch]].
*Plus 15% intelligence
* The [[Book Burner]] benefit
'''Source:''' Gold [[Talk of the Town Box]]

== Upgrade Patch (Small) ==
[[File:00672.jpg|thumb|Spider Minion Merchant Patch]]
This upgrade patch depicts a traveling Reaper Spider Minion merchant. These guys are known for their sense of humor, and I highly recommend the first thing you do the next time you meet one is to insult them. They’ll love it.

Affixing this patch to an eligible garment will imbue the following benefits:

Access to the Midnight Market. Safety or Sanity not guaranteed.

You will receive a notification if any traveling merchants are nearby.

Plus 5% to Dexterity.

Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.

== Description ==
An upgrade to the kitchen in the Royal Palace. Three cabinets are along one of the walls in the kitchen that correspond to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They synthesize the desired dish and adapt to a crawler's tastes. Supposedly there can be a "bug" where it will start spitting out the same thing every time if you order the same dish two days in a row. Carl describes the food it makes a "not bad, but not great either. The Bopca food is better." Katia and Donut were less pleased.

Upon eating a meal, the following buff notification appears:

'''“You are full! Your warm tummy increases your healing speed by 5%. It decreases debuff times by 5%. It lowers all indirect damage by 5%.”'''

The buff lasts for 30 hours. It is one of the party's daily buffs.

== AI Description ==
'''New Quest. The Vengeance of the Daughter.'''

'''Part One of Two.'''

[[Tsarina Signet]], exiled half-daughter of the Naiad has finally come home. Her kingdom, once flourishing and beautiful, has become marred by infighting and a sloppy revolution that cut off the head of the government and left the body flailing.

Signet has returned and wishes to reclaim her mother's crown. Or at the very least, put a proper government in place. In order to do that, she must assassinate the current leaders of the Naiad Confederacy, who are holed up in their fortress at the former river palace of the Naiad, now dubbed "Fort Freedom."

Help Signet assault Fort Freedom and establish revenge against her mother's assassination.

'''''Reward''''': You get to move on to part two. In addition, every survivor of the assault against the Confederacy will be 20% more willing to follow your orders. I bet that number will go up even more if you complete the second half of the quest.


'''Part Two of Two.'''

Tsarina Signet has taken back her family's castle only to find the place in ruins and the Confederacy in tatters. Her people have regressed to a time before society taught them that eating everybody they meet is just rude. They are nothing better than selfish, wild animals, reminiscent of those creatures who crawl over each other to purchase televisions on Black Friday each year. Signet has a long road ahead of her to reunite her people.

But that shit's boring, and we ain't gonna make you do have anything to do with it. We're still on the revenge track, and we're going to fast forward to the good stuff.

The true culprit in all of this are the murderous and xenophobic high elves. And since King Finian is now dead, your target is Tsarina Signet's half-sister, Queen [[Imogen]]. The reclusive, pure-blooded mage rarely ventures from her chambers deep in the impenetrable high elf castle. She does, however, make an appearance at the yearly party the high elves throw for the most elite citizens of their empire.

The same party you will be invited to should you remain one of the game's top players.

Help Signet kill Queen Imogen. Destroy the stranglehold the high elves have on the Hunting Grounds. Only then will the daughter find her revenge.

Fair warning. This one won't be nearly as easy as the last.

'''''Reward''''': Upon killing Queen Imogen, the contents of the High Elf Castle will become available to loot. There's a rumor they have something hidden within that will protect from one of Scolopendra's attacks. That, plus a metric fuck ton of other good shit.

'''The Viceroys''' are a Syndicate race and government.  They regularly participate in the Faction Wars as the [[Madness]].

{{Group|aliases=The Madness|part_of=Syndicate|type=Government|base_location=Syndicate Space|first=Book 6, Chapter 21|status=Active}}

==Description==
Marked by featureless white masks, Viceroys specialize in horrific battlefield spells and necromancy. They regularly join the [[Ninth Floor]] Faction Wars as "The [[Madness]]," and although they have not won in a few years, they often claim victory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|6|21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They won in [[Rosetta | Rosetta's]] year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributor to the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]] wondered if the viceroys were biological, as no one had seen one die.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Outside of the [[Dungeon]], the Viceroy's government allows its citizens to vote on all government expenditures, including Faction Wars expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their system is known for cheap medical procedures, and is often visited by non-Syndicate citizens and Syndicate residents living outside of the inner system (which has free health care).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Appearance==
Viceroys wear a blank white mask. 

Viceroys are humanoid aliens with long, thin bone-white necks and bulky bodies.  Under the mask, their tusked faces are bone-white.  They bleed red.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Story==
After [[Carl]] flooded Larocos, a viceroy team was eaten by a shark.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volteeg''' is a former crawler and author of the ''[[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)|Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook]]'' (7th Edition).  They contributed only a single entry to the cookbook, in which they lamented the loss of a loved one.
==Cookbook Entry==
&lt;Note added by Crawler Volteeg. Seventh Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I miss her. I miss her so goddamn much. Is it worth it? To survive this place with her gone? No. No, I don’t think it is.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Note added by Crawler [[Drakea]]. 22nd Edition&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''This is Volteeg’s first, last, and only entry in the cookbook. Fuck everything about this place.''&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Butcher's Masquerade: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 5 (p. 430). Dandy House. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Speculation==
*Given that the Cookbook enters the [[Dungeon]] only after certain criteria have been met, so typically on later levels, it is likely that the person Volteeg misses had entered the Dungeon with them.
*Note that this entry immediately precedes [[Carl | Carl's]] final interaction with [[Miriam Dom]].

| Title = Vorpal
| Definition = '''Vorpal''' is a condition that means the target has been deputized by the gods to fight demons.

Any race or creature can be vorpal, and the condition may be hidden until a demon is nearby.  Vorpals can sense demons and attract demon aggro, and grow stronger and angrier the closer they are to demons.  They explode if they think they'll lose a fight.  They will eventually dissipate and return to the celestial realm after feeding on demon blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Status Conditions]][[Category:Keywords]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

'''The Walk-On List''' is a list of "Natives" (i.e. individuals who survived the [[Transformation]] but did not enter the [[Dungeon]]) that the ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' production company would like to transform into special Dungeon Bosses to devastate the season's most popular crawlers.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|5|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list is technically illegal, as is the practice of abducting Natives, so the abductions are normally carried out by freelance bounty hunters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|4|epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few seasons before ''Dungeon Crawler World: Earth,'' a Syndicate holo drama about the Walk-On List stirred up rights organizations and political controversy.  Nothing came of it.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Description ==
'''Cost''': 15 mana

'''Target''': area around the caster

'''Duration''': unknown

At level one, it creates a 10-meter long, 2-meter high wall of magical fire. If the spell is cast on a flammable surface, the surface will catch fire once the spell ends. The fire can very easily go out of control. 

According to Mordecai, it is a common spell that can be very powerful at higher levels.

'''Walter - Sai. Level 101 Guard of the Larracos level of the Desperado Club'''

The Sai are quite serious about their guard duties, mostly because it's the only gig they can really get. They used to be firefighters, but firefighting in a war zone is a good way to make yourself almost extinct. So, they migrated into the Desperado Club and now are known as the ever-present guards of the bottom* floor of the Desperado. Focusing on their duties distracts them from all those urban legends about their armor being too itchy. These creatures aren't really known for their intelligence, but they're generally good guys, loyal until the end. That's what makes them good guards. They don't care about rules or laws or morals. They just do what they're told.

If they charge, get the hell out of the way.

[[File:00228.jpg|thumb|Weapon Box]]The Weapon Box is a [[:Category:Loot Boxes|Loot Box]] common on the [[First Floor|first floor]].  Although a [[Ranged Weapon Box|Ranged Weapons Box]] is given out on the [[Sixth Floor|sixth floor]], the basic "Weapon Box" is never mentioned again after the [[Dungeon Crawler Carl (Book)|first book]]; instead, unenchanted weapons are distributed to crawlers on deeper floors in low-tier [[Adventurer Box|Adventurer Boxes]]. 

== Bronze Weapon Box ==
Distributed as a reward for unarmed combat on the [[First Floor|first floor]], these are bronze-colored boxes approximately half the size of a military foot locker.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 5).&lt;/ref&gt;  They contain unenchanted basic weapons.

=== Sample Loot: ===

* [[Toad Cudgel]], a blunt weapon that looks like a stunted baseball bat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* '''Poker,''' a wrought-iron fireplace poker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Related Achievements: ===

* [[Unarmed Combat]]
* [[You've killed a mob with your bare fucking hands!|You've killed an armed mob with your bare fucking hands!]]

== Platinum Weapon Box ==
Distributed to the (10) crawlers who killed the first Borough Boss within 30 hours of entering the Dungeon, these boxes contained enchanted ranged weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:00613.jpg|thumb|Welcome to the neighborhood]]'''Welcome to the neighborhood!'' is an Achievement awarded for purchasing a [[Personal Space]]. 

The doorway to the personal space opens as soon as the achievement fades away.  If multiple party members purchase a personal space, the space is titled "Conjoined Personal Space of Team [Name]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|3|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI Description==
You have bought a home! It's every man's dream to someday own a place where he can fap in peace. No more filthy roommates not doing the dishes or making up excuses as to why they can't pay the rent. No more landlord who shows up without notice and conceals hidden cameras in the smoke detectors. It's all smooth sailing from now on.

''Reward:'' You're a homeowner now. That is the reward. That and taxes and having to deal with Kenneth the megalomaniac HOA president.&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. The Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook: Dungeon Crawler Carl Book 3 (p. 42). Dandy House. Kindle Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
[[Carl]] and [[Donut]] receive this achievement on the [[Fourth Floor]].  Their conjoined personal space is promptly named the [[Royal Palace of Princess Donut]].

'''New Quest. Where the Red God Glows'''

THIS IS A GROUP QUEST. All Crawlers currently within bubble number 543 will receive this quest.

''Your party has been designated Host of this Group Quest.''

No parties may opt-out of this quest.

Did you ever read the book ''Where the Red Fern Grows''?

Oh, it's great. It's about this kid who saves up his money to buy a couple of coonhounds. Little Ann and Old Dan. And there's a naughty cat involved. A bunch of stuff happens.

Anyway, did you ever notice this strange phenomenon when it comes to earth books about dogs? They always die in the end. Always. What kind of sick, sadistic fuckers are you?

Puppies shouldn't ever share a world with pain. Yet here we are. Thanks, earth culture.

[[Orthrus]] the giant puppy is getting shocked in the ass by a constant barrage of lightning. He's also getting bitten over and over in the ankles by a bunch of tenacious sharks. It's starting to hurt. Poor little guy. His health is going down.

His death will be the fault of all of you. Especially Crawler [[Carl]], who callously shoved the poor puppy into a bubble much too small and much too dangerous for him.

If Orthrus dies, the full-powered god [[Emberus]] will turn this bubble into a kiln. Good luck getting to the stairwell if that happens.

If the puppy survives the lightning storm and escapes the sharks, odds are pretty good you'll die anyway. But at least you'll die knowing you shed this world without ever causing harm to a defenseless puppy.

Oh, except Crawler [[Maggie My]]. She once ran over a baby Labrador with her Chevy Tahoe. What a bitch!

'''''Reward''''': It's a surprise.

'''Quest Complete! Where the Red God Glows!'''

You removed the puppy from danger! Hurray!

For everybody who was involved in this quest who actually didn't do anything, shame on you. The next time you're in mortal danger, I hope you remember this moment when nobody comes out of nowhere to save your ass. At least you all get the same reward.

'''''Reward''''': [[Dumber of the Flunkies|A new quest!]]

Here’s a fun fact. Other gods don’t like feral gods. They’ve been thrown into the [[Nothing]] for a reason. They tend to react to this sort of thing, depending on who you’ve brought out.

''Reward'': Whatever is about to happen is going to hit the ''[[Dungeon Crawler World]]'' blooper reel for sure.

Iron Tangle Steam Engine Train Technician.

Not all gremlins are bad or evil. Not all of them glory in the tearing of flesh and the rending of bone. Some prefer more quiet activities, such as boiler repair and heavy engineering. Then there are Grease Gremlins, who could go either way. The only thing keeping this guy from attacking you is that "Sensitivity Training" class human resources made him take in order to secure this job. As long as you don't abuse him or his beloved trains, you'll probably be fine.

      <text bytes="5253" sha1="346bypis4meocs3oi1wsb28a9qtjc9c" xml:space="preserve">The '''Manual of Style''' is a set of guidelines to ensure consistency across articles and prevent duplicate pages.  We encourage all contributors, old and new, to browse this section and our [[Spoiler Policy]] before editing. 

__TOC__

== Naming Conventions ==
In the process of cataloging, categorizing, and reorganizing articles, we found numerous duplicated pages with varying amounts of information.  To prevent further confusion and rework, we are instituting the following naming conventions:

;Double-Check.
:Before creating a new article, [[Special:Search]] the keywords to verify that the article does not already exist.  If it does exist and the title is misspelled or does not fit our naming conventions, you can flag it with the correct title by opening the ''Source Editor''' and typing '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete | Rename: correct name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' at the top of the page.  An admin will come along and sort it out.  ''(For more information on how this works, see {{t|delete}}.)'' 
**'''Note:''' ALL DUNGEON FLOORS HAVE PAGES.

;Don't start with articles (e.g. "The")
:While "The" makes the title more epic, it creates chaos in the database.  So, if you want to make a page for "The Mankini of Engorging," the page name would be "Mankini of Engorging".

;Do not capitalize prepositions or articles in a page name.  These include but are not limited to:
** and
** at
** by
** for
** from
** in
** of
** on
** or
** the
** to

;Do not capitalize file extensions.
:Always use lowercase for .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.

;Capitalize every word in the title (except those listed above).
:Even if the title is not capitalized in the book, such as in an achievement, this simply prevents duplication and prevents confusion over whether the title should be capitalized.  If an editor links to "Mankini of Engorging" on Matt Di's page, but the item's page name is "Mankini of engorging", the link will appear broken on Matt Di's page.

;Use Character's names, not titles.
:For the sake of consistency, the page name should be the character's given name and not their title (e.g. "Donut" rather than "Princess Donut"). 

== Formatting Articles ==
We try to maintain a semi-consistent format across articles. 

;Top Level Summary
:Above any header, there should be a succinct 1-2 sentence summary of the topic.  The subject should be mentioned by name, and the first instance of the subject's name should be in bold.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Matt Di''' is a Crawler from Earth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Quotes
:'''Decorative Quotes.'''  Use these only once, at the very top of the page.  Note that  For best results, you can Insert &gt; Template &gt; Quote in Visual Editor or type '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Quote | quote = your quote &lt;small&gt;-- [[Speaker]] (Book #, Chapter #)&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' in Source Editor.
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''All other quotes.''' All other quotes should be entered as inline quotes or, if more than a few lines, formatted as blockquotes.  Of course, if the decorative quote would make a bigger impact (as in the [[Dungeon Anarchist's Cookbook (Item)]]), then use the decorative quote.
&lt;br/&gt;
:All quotes should be properly attributed to the source material.
 
;Citations
:Always include a "References" header and references list at the bottom of the page.  Not sure how?  Ask an admin!

;Links to other pages.
:The &lt;u&gt;first time&lt;/u&gt; the subject of another page is mentioned, it should be linked. The page should be clearly identified so that the reader knows what it links to (e.g. "The neighbor's dog, [[Angel]], bit down" versus "[[Angel | the neighbor's dog]] bit down").  Subsequent mentions of the topic do not need to be linked.


== Suggested Standardized Article Categories ==
This is not a hard and fast list; however, we recommend using the Infoboxes and Navboxes where available.

=== Characters ===
* '''Character_info''' Infobox
* '''Description'''.  An overview of this character and their personality.  
* '''Appearance'''. If I wanted to illustrate this character, what details would I need?
* '''History'''.
* '''Story'''. Remember to abide by our [[Spoiler Policy]] and take advantage of our awesome spoiler tools!
* '''Progression'''. The character's levels, stats, and gear,  broken up by book or by floor.  Once again, remember our Spoiler Policy.
* '''Trivia'''. For the weird facts that don't fit anywhere, like the exact size of Carl's foot.
* '''Speculation'''.  Theories that make sense based on stated evidence (preferably in the section) but cannot be supported or verified by the text.

Note that our two protagonists, [[Carl]] and [[Donut]], have their own categories and more page options than other characters.

=== Items ===
* '''Items infobox.'''
* '''AI Description.''' What the AI ''says'' the item does.
* '''Description'''.  What the item actually does, and how it works.
* '''Appearance'''.  If I wanted to illustrate this item, what details would I need? Sometimes this will be covered in description.
* '''Operation'''.  For digging deep into how something works, like the [[Goblin Copper Chopper]].
* '''Story'''.  Relevance to the story so far.
* '''Trivia'''.
* '''Speculation'''.
* {{t|Navbox Items}} &lt;-- add to the bottom of every items page, below the references.

== AI Description ==
'''Cost''': 5 Mana

'''Target''': Self Only

'''Duration''': 5 minutes + 1 minute per level of spell. Requires 5 minute cooldown.

Surrounds your body with tendrils of light. While ineffective against physical attacks, this spell negates 75% of incoming damage from magic-based attacks. Provides temporary immunity to mind-control effects. Higher skill levels increase both effectiveness and duration. It also makes you look all wispy and ethereal and druid-like. A great spell to have if you’re a club kid or trying to bang a vegan.

== AI Description ==
The Dirigible Gnomes were once a peaceful race. All they ever wanted were two things. One, to figure out how the world worked. And two, to be left alone.

In order to escape a busy, teeming world filled with competing intelligent species, all of whom loved to wage war, the Dirigible Gnomes learned how to take to the clouds, building a variety of airships and floating settlements, allowing them to escape any sort of trouble.

But as we all know, trouble doesn't care if you want to be found.

The history of the Dirigible Gnomes is long, complicated, and tragic. But the end result is the inevitable result of all peaceful races. They were forced to choose between fighting or being wiped out. They chose to fight.

Wynne is the great and favored uncle of [[Commandant Kane]] of the Dreadnaught ''[[Wasteland]]''. He is a Flesh Mechanic, a healer gifted with the ability to bring the dead back to life, if only temporarily. He is being held as hostage by the Dromedarians, as a guarantee of peace.

== Shrine ==
If her shrine is repaired she will give each squad a special card. [[Eileithyia|Eileithya]] will also grant a single boon to each participant.

== AI Description ==
'''Goddess of Rivers Yemaya. Level 250.'''

'''This is a locked deity. She will not be sponsored this season.'''

'''This goddess is a retainer of [[Eileithyia]].'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. She is invulnerable on this floor.'''

''This goddess is in her own temple. Temple appearance rules apply. That means watch the fuck out.''

Yemaya was once the goddess of all oceans, all bodies of water big and small. But she was more than that, too. She was the queen of love and the bringer of life. But, eventually, her people died off, her temples crumbled, and she was forgotten by all except her dear friend, the goddess Eileithyia, who wished every day that her old friend could someday come back from the land of the forgotten.

Now that Yemaya has re-ascended into the Halls, she will have a lot of work to do to make certain nobody ever forgets her name again. She's an unlikely candidate to claim the throne, but she would work tirelessly for her good friend Eileithyia, should she desire such a burden.

== Entries ==
Reading the words of those who have come before me, I know them. You, reading this. I know you, too. You are me. That is who this book finds. I have been alone my whole life. I have been surrounded by my hive, yet I have been alone. That is okay, I now know. It is acceptable to have your own thoughts, your own mind, despite what they say. But it is also acceptable to be alone and want the strength of the hive. There is no shame in that. No contradiction. That is what this book attempts. To make a hive of those who will never cross paths, except in these pages. Yet sometimes this book is not enough. You sometimes want more. You want to belong. Again, there is no shame. There is no shame in wanting to be alone yet also wanting the comfort and the strength of your brethren. But more importantly, there is no shame in wanting to protect those who are your hive, even if you never knew them. For they are yours, and they are being taken. It is us or it is them. There is consolation in dying in the pursuit of justice, no matter how small or big that death is. (Chapter 15, Book 3)

''But you can sure die trying.''

You have discovered a city boss!

That's right. Let me say that again for the assholes in the back.

A.

CITY.

FUCKING. 

BOSS.

Welp. If you gonna go, you might as well do it with style.

Just an FYI. As of this moment in the current season of ''Dungeon Crawler World'', not a single Crawler has faced a city boss and survived. And for good reason. Only a complete moron would voluntarily put themselves in a situation where they had to fight one of the most powerful monsters on the level.

''Reward:'' A lot of people are probably going to watch you die. That's a better prize than most of us get.

Okay, okay. Unless you’re a complete psychopath, we know you probably didn’t wake up this morning and tell yourself, “Today is the day I’m going to slaughter a child.” Well let us put your mind at ease. All children mobs who die within this dungeon don’t actually perish. They’re transferred to a holding area where they’re safe and treated nicely and gently until they can be reunited with their loving parents at the end of the season.

Feel better? Good.

A mob has been injured because of something you purposely left lying around the dungeon. From scattered Legos to spiked pits to buckets of flesh-devouring Skinner Ants to dimensional rifts that instantly boil all the blood in one's body, the art of trapmaking has a celebrated and storied history in the annals of ''Dungeon Crawler World''.

So if you're going to do it, you better do it right. Whatever it was that gave you this achievement, it was probably something stupid. This will help you make the next trap more... exciting.

'''Warning: This sponsor is ''not'' currently inhabiting the shell of this deity. She will speak and react as per her regular nature. Considering who this is, that's some bad fucking news for you guys.'''

'''Warning: This is a deity. She is invulnerable on this floor.'''

''This goddess has been temporarily summoned to this location due to a special boss battle event and will return to the Ascendancy upon completion of the event.''

The earliest citizens of Larracos always worshipped Ysalte, which is fitting. She hasn't always been considered the Goddess of Hopelessness and Insanity. First it was of the Dirt. Then it was of Tears. It's a recent thing that they started calling her something else. The Downward Spiral. The Vinegar Bitch. 

Her downfall mirrors that of the citizens of Larracos, who have embraced the deity in all her forms.

That's what happens when everything you know is upended, and everything is taken from you. First they vilify you. Then they separate you. Then they blame you for what they're doing to you. Then they hunt you. It's the step after which is important.

The one where they start to fear you.

Ysalte has a special place in her heart for the outcasts, for those whose minds are being devoured by the world around them. She takes no new worshippers, beyond the citizens of Larracos. But she is known to be a great patron of the arts and is one of the few deities who will sponsor a bard or a performer. She asks nothing in return, though occasionally her gifts are more than what they seem, and some may even carry a curse.

The story of this goddess, like that of many of her kind, is long and a little sad. At this point, how it began isn't nearly as important as how it will end. She is half-sister and niece to her former lover, [[Taranis]]. Threatened with the Nothing by [[Apito]], she fled to Sheol. She has since returned to the Halls of Ascendancy, where she is feared and reviled by all.

She is not considered someone who wishes to lead, which makes her a dangerous and cunning contender for the Ascendancy throne.

Daughter of [[Maggie My]] and [[Frank Q]]. Advised by their game guide to kill other players, but refuses, even as her parents stalk and kill eight, including [[Rebecca W]].

Injured when Frank Q takes a lit stick of dynamite from a booby-tapped rat corpse left by [[Carl]]. Strangled to death by Maggie My. It was later revealed that she was using the [[Enchanted Night Wyrm’s Ring of Divine Suffering]] when she was injured which made it impossible to heal her wounds.

== Relationships ==
She didn't get on well with her parents and was running away from home when the dungeon was created.

Hunter, killed by his own traps when Carl cast ''[[Tripper]]''. He was the final Hunter on floor 6.

He hunts for the survival of the [[Atoll]], using the money to pay for the upkeep of his habitat as their races has limited employment opportunities. Without the money from hunting crawlers his community would have to agree an indentureship with another system.

His [[Night Weasel|night weasel]] mobs attacked [[Carl]] as he entered the floor.

He managed to collect twenty five crawlers sculpts.

==Gear==
He owns a trappers bandoleer.

He got a Drop Sheild and an Invisibility Pack from the prize counter.

This spell transfers a town or city and all the NPC's inside it to a random location one floor down (on the [[Scolopendra|Scolopendra Level]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, it skips to the next Scolopendra Level). It has a five-minute cast, and can only be used at the end of a floor. When the town lands, it kills everything it lands on, which is immediately respawned as a [[Child of Inpewt]]. The Children actively hunt everyone in the town and the caster until they are all dead. Any townspeople killed also turn into Children.&lt;blockquote&gt;

'''Zev''' is the [[Royal Court of Princess Donut]]'s "Outreach Associate" or PR agent.

== Description ==
Zev works in the [[Borant Corporation]] communications department as a low-ranked liaison between her company and privately-produced shows that want to feature crawlers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She monitors her clients, coordinates their show appearances, hosts focus groups to gather viewers' opinions, and has the power to sign official documents on her clients' behalf.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|1|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{ref|2|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Kua-Tin]] who is not a member of the controlling political party, the [[Bloom|Bloom]], she struggles to advance her career, but she tries to put her clients' best interests first.

[[Donut]] and Zev quickly bond over their shared love of scripted Earth television, and begin chatting nonstop.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|1|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They plan to write an intergalactic version of ''Gossip Girl'' together after Donut leaves the Dungeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The first time Zev ventures into the Dungeon (appearing in the room with a ''pop''), she kits herself out in full-body armor because there are no [[Protections | protections]] for staff on the first three floors: a round glass helmet filled with bubbling water piped from a bulky backpack, and a white mesh "spacesuit."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At all times, even in armor, she is required to wear a badge indicating that she is not a member of the Bloom.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==History==
Zev has been in Earth's orbit for fifteen years with nothing to watch but Earth programs.  She is particularly fond of ''Gossip Girl'' and ''Riverdale.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She tried to write a ''Gossip Girl'' fanfic, but it didn't receive many hits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;


== Story ==
Not long after meeting [[Carl]] and [[Donut]], Zev makes the mistake of warning Carl about the [[Rage Elemental]] over chat and is censured by the [[System AI]] for "Cheating."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She successfully appeals the ruling and clears her record, but notes, "Once the AI notices you, it's difficult to get it to un-notice you, so I have to be extra careful from now on."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{ref|1|44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Third Floor]], Zev continues to keep Carl and Donut apprised of public opinion. She helps Carl negotiate with the ''[[Vengeance of the Daughter]]'' producers, and -- intentionally or not -- clues him into Donut and Mongo's predicament by saying, "It's amazing.  Both of these dramas playing out at the same time."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  Although she can'not tell them anything about the greater universe that they don't already know, Zev does her best to give Carl and Donut as much information as possible without breaking the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|2|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeynep''' is a crawler from the middle east.  She and [[Carl]] trade fist bumps on the [[Eighth Floor]].

==Description==
Zeynep is a middle aged middle eastern woman whose crawler ID is similar enough to those of her three other party members that [[Carl]] suspects they entered the [[Dungeon]] together. She may also be in a party with [[Burcu]].

Carl finds her, [[Emir Akbas]], and two younger women dancing together in the [[Desperado Club]] shortly before executing the assassination.  Zeynep is the only member of her four-person group to trade contact info with him, and ultimately casts [[Mute]] on Emir to prevent him from attacking Carl.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zhang''' is a crawler from China.  He is partied with [[Li Na]] and [[Li Jun]].

==Description==
On Earth, Zhang and his best friend Li Jun worked together at a warehouse in China.  They entered the [[Dungeon]] with their warehouse manager and Li Na, who Zhang has a crush on.  On the [[Second Floor]], Zhang and Li Jun appear on ''[[Death Watch Extreme Dungeon Mayhem]]'' with [[Carl]], who gives them advice that allows them to save their party.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  The group are now unwavering allies of the [[Royal Court of Princess Donut]], but neither Zhang nor Li Jun are willing to tell Carl when his plans are terrible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{ref|3|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang chooses to remain [[Human]] during [[Third Floor]] race selection, and takes the mage/tank-combo [[Earth Mover]] [[Class]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{ref|3|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Appearance ==
Zhang is bald.  By the Fourth Floor, he is equipped with glowing, black and gold segmented armor.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

==Story==
Zhang, Li Jun, their manager, and Li Na defeat a neighborhood boss during their first week in the Dungeon. The four-person group is boxed in between hatching [[Brindle Vespa]] and [[Troglodyte]]s on the [[Second Floor]] when a [[Time Freeze Spell]] hits them and Zhang and Li Jun are teleported onto the [[Maestro | Maestro's]] show, ''Death Watch Extreme Mayhem''.  Zhang wants to use their two "teleport points" to rescue Li Jun and Li Na from the impossible situation, sacrificing himself, before Carl whispers instructions to escape the situation and manipulates the Maestro into sending the men back before the spell expires. Abruptly teleported back to the fight, Zhang is the first to react; he barks orders at Li Jun, grabs their severely injured manager, and the group shoulder their way passed the lizards and to safety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{ref|1|42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Spoiler | book = 3 | spoiler = Their group grows to twelve members before they meet Carl again on the [[Fourth Floor]] Iron Tangle. At some point in the past two floors, Zhang received a [[Shrink Wand]], which he previously used to choke a monster to death with its own collar, and to shrink an oncoming train, killing every mob on board. He gained six levels, a [[Boss Box]], and a multi-kill box for doing so.  After Carl saves their group for a second time, Zhang gifts him the wand a single charge left.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  He, Li Jun, and Li Na are instrumental in orchestrating the finale on the Fourth Floor.  Zhang pilots the portal cart.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;}}{{Spoiler |book = 4 
| spoiler = In the [[Fifth Floor]] Bubbles, Zhang's team close in on their final quadrant (an underwater castle) with just under five days remaining on the timer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Carl begins using the [[Gate of the Feral Gods]], Zhang uncharacteristically descends the stairs but leaves Li Jun and Li Na behind to report on the neighboring bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{Spoiler |book = 5 
| spoiler = Zhang's team works with [[Katia Grim | Katia Grim's]] team on the [[Sixth Floor]] Hunting Grounds, helping her track down [[Eva Sigrid]].

| spoiler = Zhang's team chooses Beijing for the first phase of the [[Eighth Floor]], and joins [[Safehome Yolanda]] after the [[Guilds]] system. In the third phase, they arrive at the Soho Building after the [[Battle of Beijing]], and meet [[Lucia Mar]] in the stairwell.  She gives them the [[Doggy Door]] personal space upgrade.  Zhang, Li Jun, and Li Na proceed to install it in [[Imani C]]'s room and use it to carry out Carl's "suicide mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carl puts Zhang in charge of using Carl's new Shrink Wand, and Zhang only uses two charges before returning it to Carl.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|6|72}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


==Progression==
===Second Floor===
When Zhang appears on ''Death Watch'', he does not have an obvious weapon. His stats are:
*Level: 7 
*Constitution: 15
*Strength: 8 

===Fourth Floor===
Li Jun is now Level 28 and equipped with unidentified enchanted armor.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  He knows [[Dirt Clod]] and has immunity to acid attacks.

===Sixth Floor===
Li Jun demonstrates an ability to extend the timers on unconscious mobs.

The '''Zulu Warrior''' is a class available on the [[Third Floor|third floor]]. It was picked by [[Chris Andrews|Chris Andrews 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Speculation ==
It seems very likely that this is an Earth Class. It may be a Fighter subclass inspired by the impi/tribal zulu warriors, who were known to wield spears and shields.&lt;ref&gt;"Impi." ''Wikipedia''. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impi#:~:text=In%20English%20impi%20is%20often,in%20Zulu%20or%20the%20army. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impi#:~:text=In%20English%20impi%20is%20often,in%20Zulu%20or%20the%20army.]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chris Andrews|Chris Andrews 2]] received an enchanted spear on the first floor,&lt;ref&gt;Dinniman, Matt. ''Dungeon Crawler Carl'' (chapter 26).&lt;/ref&gt; and - as a [[cretin]] - is essentially a walking shield.

{{Spoiler
| book = 4
| spoiler = It's possible that it could also be a Mage subclass as [[Vadim]] claimed that [[Chris Andrews|Chris]] had a lot of spells.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Of coursem these may have been [[Maggie My|Maggie's]] spells.
