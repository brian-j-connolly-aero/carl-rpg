qwop?: Testing, testing, hope that worked.
qwop?: We'll know in 20 seconds.

qwop?: Does it keep working now? I think it might.
qwop?: I think it might. Was it working this whole time?
qwop?: That's embarrassing.
qwop?: That is embarrassing.
qwop?: Yeah.
qwop?: Yeah.
qwop?: Yeah, great.
qwop?: OK, it's working.
qwop?: Mm-hmm, still working.
qwop?: No, no errors.
qwop?: No, nothing.
qwop?: 10 seconds.
qwop?: Yeah, I think that's fine.
qwop?: I think it's fine.

qwop?: Another test.






qwop?: Yeah, or more audio.
michiderp: say random words or it's going to be recording and transcribing stuff if that's okay
michiderp: say those
michiderp: It was way too much.
michiderp: The one perpetrator said, oh, when I was with Jennifer,
michiderp: I was guarding her with a gun, and my hands were shaking,
michiderp: and I was so afraid.
michiderp: I just wanted to get out of there,
michiderp: and it accidentally went off.
michiderp: No, it did not.
michiderp: The reason we know that is because Jennifer's head
michiderp: won't move.
michiderp: it was a close contact. So don't tell me you wiggle it and shake it and it accidentally
michiderp: went off. No, you held it purposely with full intent and you shot it.
michiderp: Is it not working?
qwop?: I think so, right?
qwop?: Um, there are, are there no more words?
